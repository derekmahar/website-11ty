Well, this is quite embarrassing. &nbsp;Thank you for the information! Actually, my blog entries on my feed page did have p-names but I think I accidentally made them part of the e-content, and I suspect that's why they were not showing up.    And, yes, my published date was embedded in my h-card for silly reasons that I won't get into.     Anyway, I think (hope) I've fixed both issues if you want to try again.
