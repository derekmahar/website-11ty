I do something vaguely similar with my media endpoint, except I use a server that I rent out from from kimsufi, where I also host my webmention and micropub endpoints.    But...does it ever bother you to split your content like this? &nbsp;I use a static site generator, and one of the nice things about this is that your *entire* site can be generated from the contents of your local folder. &nbsp;When part of your content (your photos) live somewhere else (a media server, or a CDN, or whatever), that's no longer the case.    This bothers me somewhat, though I don't lose any sleep over it. &nbsp;I don't really have a good answer for it.
