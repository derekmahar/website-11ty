I enjoy *writing* software more than I enjoy *using* software.  I'm not
berating myself over this, nor am I proud of it.  It's just how I am.

What this means in practice is that I will often write a whole *bunch* of
code before I even start trying to debug it.  Writing code tickles what I
imagine is the creative part of my brain, and it feels good.  Running and
debugging code tickles the "chore" part of my brain and it doesn't feel as
good.

(Yes, programming is *creative*.  It's an act of creation.  I'm emphasizing
this point because there is a tendency in non-technical circles to view
programming as something sterile or clinical, like accounting.  I would
imagine, however, that there are very few accountants who do accounting in
their spare time, whereas you can easily find tons of programmers who do
coding in their spare time, myself included).

Writing huge swaths of code that don't run is obviously not ideal.  Since
part of my job is, in fact, to produce working code, I obviously know how to
debug, and I do.  It's just that I could probably be more productive if I
took a breath, stepped back and started trying things out earlier in the
process than I usually do.

This is especially true in my hobby projects.  Those are meant to be purely
for fun, and so I tend to put an emphasis on the parts I enjoy, which is
creating the software.  I obviously do get some enjoyment from seeing it
work, so I do of course eventually get it running (err...sometimes...) but
much later than I should.

I think this is part of the reason I will often spend days setting up
elaborate todo systems with [org mode][1] and [Emacs][2], and then never
follow through with using them.  I'm surely beating a dead horse by now, but
writing software is fun; using software, particularly my own, is another
matter entirely.

What do I do about this?  I have no idea.  I'm not even sure there's
anything *to* do.  I mean, I'm mostly productive.  I do, for the most part,
produce stuff that, on some level, works.  Eventually.

I'm not even sure what I want to get out of this blog entry.  I think I
just wanted to get it off my chest.

Still, self-improvement is a good thing and as I get older I find myself
wanting to be a little more practical so maybe I should look into improving
this.

Maybe more unit testing?  That seems plausible - combine programming with
testing.  It could work.

Then again, I'm not a young man and retirement is...well, it's not *close*
but it's no longer unfathomably far away.  So maybe life is short and I
don't bother.

I'd be curious to see which side of me wins out.
