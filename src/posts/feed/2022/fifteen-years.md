Fifteen years ago today, I published my first blog post and I wanted to mark
the occasion with - you guessed it! - a blog post.  I didn't really have a
strong sense of what I wanted to say but, anniversaries being a chance to
reminisce, I found myself revisiting what I've written over the years.

It's definitely a mixed bag.  The tone and content vary wildly.  For this
reason, when people ask me what this blog is "about", I usually have trouble
answering, and this sometimes catches them off guard because common wisdom
states that blogs typically have themes.  People will have a food blog, for
example, or a programming blog, or a reading blog.  Among other things, it's
a way to collect followers - people seem to place greater trust in a blog
when it focuses on one subject.

I'm not so precious as to claim that I don't care about readers *at all* -
believe it or not, I do like it when people read my posts - but I *will*
say, being completely honest, that it's not a huge concern, and gaining
readers has very little do with why this blog exists.  I've tried, over the
years, to keep track of visitors (first with piwik and then with google
analytics) but I inevitably end up abandoning the effort as not worth my
time.

In any case, I've always resisted the temptation to try and pigeonhole this
project.  My blog, like me, is a bit all over the place.  It doesn't have a
theme other than "stuff Desmond finds interesting".  It's a purely selfish
creative outlet, a dim extension of myself, and sticking to one subject
would run counter to that purpose.

All that being said, I did notice, poring over my writing through the years,
that certain patterns do stand out.  And, even though my blog isn't about
anything in particular, individual posts generally *are*, so given that this
post should probably be about *something*, let's explore!

## The Diary - Part 1

The first year of my blog tended to be somewhat diary oriented.  There's a
post in there about attending my friend Neil's bachelor party.  There's
another post about nothing more than the fact that it's snowing outside.
There's a brief one on hockey riots and another about my trip on a glider.

This kind of content pretty much stopped after the first year, except for
the occasional vacation post (see, for example, my post about my trip to
Greece, the one about my trip to Poland, and the one where I visited Chicago
and New York).  These are actually a lot of fun to write and I should
probably should have written more of them.

Thinking about it now, I joined Facebook the same year that I started my
blog, and I would imagine it's not a coincidence that these kinds of diary
entries began to dry up as I became more active on social media.  Facebook
effectively became my diary, I suppose.  It makes me a bit sad to think
about it.

## The Gap

There's a three year gap from 2008-2011, ostensibly because my blog got
overrun with spam.  A number of life events happened in that gap - my dad
died, for one, and I also bought a 100 year old apartment.  It's a shame
that I don't have any posts about that.

But this, in fact, appears to be a pattern with me.  I don't really have a
lot of personal articles on my blog.  As I mentioned, "diary" content more
or less stopped after the first year.  I do share a lot of opinions, which
are obviously personal, but I don't really share what's going on in my
life - at least, not on my blog.

Some exceptions do exist.  I published a relatively personal post about
religion back in 2016.  I published a fairly introspective post about the
Canada Malting silos way back in 2013.  But day-to-day stuff?  Not so much.

This changes somewhat when I started participating in the IndieWeb.  Read on
for more information on *that*.

## On Being Meta

One thing that hasn't changed is that I tend to blog a lot about blogging,
particularly about the technology or workflow I'm using at the time.  In
fact, "blogging" is the single biggest entry on my tag page.  I'm not sure
what to make of that, except that I suppose I tend to fall into the common
nerd trap of getting caught up in the tools I use.

What can I say?  Blogging software (and web publishing software in general,
really) is a topic that fascinates me. I'm old enough to still be amazed at
the idea that a random person can put a random web page on a random web
server and have it be instantly accessible to the rest of the world.

I started this blog with an obscure little Perl program called Blosxom,
moved on fairly quickly to my own homegrown engine called YAWT (first
written in Perl, then in Python) and I eventually started using Pelican when
I got tired of fixing bugs in my own code.  I've recently switched to using
Eleventy.

If you're at all familiar with blogging software, you may have noticed that
certain popular programs like Wordpress are not on the list.  That's because
I like writing all my blog entries in a plain text editor (usually Emacs)
and saving them as vanilla text files on disk, a personal idiosyncrasy which
informs my choice of publishing software.  The longevity of my blog can at
least partially be attributed to the fact that my content is stored this
way, and can be processed by relatively low-tech digital tools (i.e. any
text editor, on any platform).  This is a topic that probably deserves its
own post.

## On Being a Geek

I also appear write a lot about programming, which is not entirely
unexpected given what I do for a living (spoiler: I'm a software developer).
It *is* kind of interesting to see how these articles change over time.  I
wrote a couple of Perl articles in 2007, when I was still using Blosxom.  I
started writing about Python in 2012, a couple of years after I attended
OOPSLA, and I decided that I wanted to learn a dynamic language that wasn't
Perl.  I eventually moved on to Typescript.

Mixed with all of that are a handful of articles on Emacs, which in terms of
subject matter tend to blur the line between blogging and programming.
Emacs has traditionally been my text editor of choice over the years, which
implicitly involves writing a fair amount of Lisp (specifically Emacs Lisp),
a fascinating language that can occasionally beguile a person with
mathematical inclinations (like me).

## The Diary - Part 2

I joined the IndieWeb sometime in 2018 and immediately became consumed by
it, as attested by the fact that "indieweb" is the second most frequently
used tag on my blog after "blogging".

The IndieWeb is a loose community of people trying to re-popularize the
personal website and, by extension, the personal blog.  So I guess you could
say that my interest in this subject is just an extension of my interest in
blogging.

Joining the IndieWeb has had a profound effect on the format and structure
of my blog.  The most prominent changes, from a reader's perspective, would
probably be the introduction of notes and webmentions.

The ability to publish short, quick notes (think tweets or status updates)
on my blog basically means that I can more easily use this platform for
purposes that hitherto had been mostly the purview of Facebook and Twitter -
namely day-to-day, diary oriented musings.  The introduction of webmentions
have added a sense of community.

Effectively, participating in the IndieWeb has resulted in a kind of
renaissance of the diary aspects of my blog, and a lessening of the
reliance on Facebook and Twitter, which is nice.

## Apparently I Like To Drink

A number of posts involve cooking and cocktails.  More cocktails than
cooking if I'm honest.

I enjoy mixing drinks.  I'm not entirely sure why. It's not to get drunk; I
almost always stop at one or two.  I think it has something to do with my
childhood fascination with chemistry.  Mixing a drink is like a science
experiment.

For while I was really into crafting my own mixers.  I have a couple of
articles on making my own tonic water, and one on how to make my own
grenadine.  I have a series of posts on how I use what are traditionally
labelled as "mixing liqueurs", like vermouth or Chartreuse.
