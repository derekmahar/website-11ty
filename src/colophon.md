I've maintained some form of personal online presence since roughly 1998 or
so, when I made my first hand coded HTML pages available on the web.
There have been several incarnations of this site over the years, hosted
variously on [U of T][1] servers, [Geocities][2], [Netfirms][3] and a raft
of dedicated home and [rented][4] machines, but the current version is now
hosted on [Netlify][5] and I haven't found the experince too painful so I'm
going to try and make it last.

These days I'm using [eleventy][6] to build this site; when it comes to
content management systems, I favour plain text files over databases, which
means I avoid software like Wordpress.  I've used a variety of other tools
in the past, from an obscure, Perl-based blogging engine called
[Blosxom][7], to my own homegrown system called [YAWT][8], onto a relatively
mainstream program called [Pelican][9].  I suspect eleventy will not be the
final link in this chain, but we'll see how long it lasts.

This site is part of the [IndieWeb][10], a collection of personal websites
that function as a kind of alternative to traditional social media.  I
discovered the community sometime in early 2019 and I've been since hard at
work to make my site compliant.  Mostly this means that I try to post
content here first, and then syndicate it elsewhere.  My success rate
varies.
