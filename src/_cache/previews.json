      "content": "<h1 id=\"our-data-scattered\">Our data, scattered</h1>\n\n<p>A while back I started to <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://blog.b-ark.ca/2018/01/01/fun-with-puppeteer.html\">take</a> an <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://blog.b-ark.ca/2018/01/02/html-json-data-archiving.html\">interest</a> in the topic of personal data archiving, and in particular how the topic intersects with the various social media platforms that so many of us interact with.  The simple fact is that so much of who we are–the things we write, the photos and videos we take, the people we interact with, our very memories, as Facebook likes to remind us–are locked up in a bunch of different walled gardens that are difficult to escape, both technically and due to the powerful social pressures that keep us on these platforms.</p>\n\n<p>I like to think of the traditional photo album as an interesting contrast.</p>\n\n<p>It used to be that we collected memories in these books, and stored those books on a shelf.  There was some real downsides to this approach!  It’s a pain to add stuff to them (I have to “print” photos??)  They’re difficult to share and enjoy.  They’re single points of failure (think: house fires).  They require intentional acts to ensure preservation.  The list goes on.</p>\n\n<p>But, they were ours.  We owned them.  We could take those photos and easily copy them, share them, rearrange them, archive them, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine that you collected all your photos in a photo album that you could only store and access from a vault being run by a private company.  The company would ensure the photos were protected and stored properly, and they provided a really nice, simple mechanism to easily add photos to your album right from your phone!  That’s really nice!  But if you wanted to look at those photos, you’d have to go to the vault, enter your passcode, and then you could only look at them while you were in the vault.  And if you wanted to get a copy of all of those photos for yourself, well, you can, but it’s ugly and complicated and designed to make it minimally possible and maximally difficult.</p>\n\n<p>Next, imagine the corporation changed their policies in a way you didn’t like.  Or imagine that corporation went bankrupt.  Or experienced a fire.  Or you lost the passcode for that vault.  Or a loved one passed away and didn’t store the passcode in a safe place.</p>\n\n<p>What then?</p>\n\n<p>Today, we don’t just lock those photos in one vault run by one private company.  We lock those photos in many vaults, spread out all over the place.  In doing so, we dramatically increase these risks, because instead of just one company failing or one account that we might lose access to or one set of terms of service we need to worry about, it’s many.</p>\n\n<p>All the while we fragment our identity, spreading ourselves thin across the internet, which makes it extremely difficult to preserve all of those memories.</p>\n\n<p>So what can we do about it?</p>\n\n<!-- more -->\n\n<h1 id=\"building-a-social-hub\">Building a social hub</h1>\n\n<p>Imagine there was a way you could carve out a space on the internet that was exclusively your own.  In this space you could decide for yourself what you wanted to broadcast to the world.  It could be a place for you to post short notes, long articles, photos, videos, book reviews, or really anything else that you wanted to share with your friends and family.  All the content could appear in one location, rather than being fractured and spread out across a dozen little places out of your control.</p>\n\n<p>In this place you could carefully curate your identity.  If you want to share something, you make the choice to share it.  If you want to delete something, you make the choice to delete it.  You never have to worry about your information being taken without your consent because it’s your space.  You own it, and you control it.</p>\n\n<p>And what about all those social media walled gardens where all of your friends and family currently reside?  Well, imagine you could take the content from your personal space and selectively choose to share things on those services.  Even better, imagine you could pull the social interactions in those walled gardens back to your own space so that, no matter where they happened, they could all be collected in one place.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, imagine there was any easy way to interact with other personal spaces from your own, so that social interactions could happen directly rather than through those proprietary communities.</p>\n\n<p>In this world, because the content is entirely under your control, there is no risk of a service going down or an account being lost.  Data collection and archiving happen automatically because the content you post is going to a single place that is a service you control.  In short:  you own your photo album again.  Except you get all those other benefits, including easy publishing, sharing, and so forth, as well.</p>\n\n<p>This is the idea behind the <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://indieweb.org\">IndieWeb</a>, where folks are developing the tools and technologies that will allow the personal website or blog to evolve into a central social identity.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"challenges-with-the-personal-website\">Challenges with the personal website</h1>\n\n<p>When contrasting the personal website to the rise of social media, it’s obvious the latter succeeded by providing a number of significant advantages<sup id=\"fnref:1\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">1</a></sup>:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Minimizes friction for content creation.</li>\n  <li>Enables simple, easy, complex social interaction, including liking, sharing, etc.</li>\n  <li>Standardizes the presentation of content and makes it available wherever we are.</li>\n  <li>Connects folks together on a single platform.</li>\n  <li>Makes it easy to find content, through both social filtering and algorithmic recommendation.</li>\n  <li>Requires no technical expertise to get involved.  Just sign up and go.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>By contrast, when looking at blogs or personal websites, you find:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Content authoring and social interaction has gone mobile, with an emphasis on short-form content, photos, videos, etc, while blogs have typically been reserved for higher-effort, long-form publishing.</li>\n  <li>Personal websites aren’t well-connected; sharing, liking, commenting, and so forth, is difficult across the distributed web.</li>\n  <li>Personal websites are varied and disparate, making interoperability a challenge.</li>\n  <li>Our contacts on social media won’t follow us to our websites if we leave.</li>\n  <li>Curation and content discovery are a significant challenge in the distributed web.</li>\n  <li>Building and maintaining a personal website can be technically challenging and, for most, is not worth the trouble.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>The folks behind the IndieWeb movement are trying to tackle these various issues through a mix of technology and recommended best practices.</p>\n\n<p>Now, to be clear, there’s still a ton of work to do, and the barrier to entry is still very high.  But there is progress being made that leads me to be slightly optimistic that the IndieWeb can, if not completely replace social media, at least provide a viable alternative for those searching for one.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"simplifying-content-creation\">Simplifying content creation</h1>\n\n<p>Because personal websites are so varied and disparate, it’s very difficult to build clean, simple, easy-to-use applications that can reduce the barriers to content creation.</p>\n\n<p>The first step in solving this issue is to create a lingua franca that clients and websites can use to talk to each other.  The IndieWeb proposes the W3C draft standard <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://micropub.net/\">Micropub</a> protocol as the solution.</p>\n\n<p>Micropub is an extremely simple, lightweight, flexible protocol that allows clients to talk to websites.  The protocol is so simple that I actually wrote my own, <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://github.com/fancypantalons/lillipub\">custom Micropub implementation</a> for use with my website, just for the intellectual exercise.</p>\n\n<p>Now, obviously building your own Micropub endpoint is not for the feint of heart, but fortunately there are <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Servers#CMS_Software\">plugins</a> for a number of common CMSes and blogging engines (including Wordpress).</p>\n\n<p>Combined with a <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://indieweb.org/Micropub/Clients\">Micropub client</a>–I personally use <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://github.com/swentel/indigenous-android/\">Indigenous</a>–it’s becoming possible to post notes, articles, photos, or other content to a personal website right from your phone as easy as it is to write a tweet or post to Facebook.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"diversifying-content-standardizing-semantics\">Diversifying content, standardizing semantics</h1>\n\n<p>It’s time to break the stereotype of the blog as a place where we only post long-form content.  As my own website illustrates, it is not only possible, but exciting and freeing to post a diversity of types of content to personal websites, including short-form notes, photos, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Even better, since its your website, you can present that content however you like!  Do you want a single merged timeline?  Timelines for different types of content?  Something completely different?  That’s entirely up to you to decide!</p>\n\n<p>However, this diversity of presentation does present issues when trying to encourage interaction between websites, content aggregators, and so forth.</p>\n\n<p>And this is where <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/http://microformats.org/\">Microformats</a> come in.</p>\n\n<p>Where RSS and ATOM provide excellent mechanisms for broadcasting a feed of content, Microformats allow us to embed structural semantics right into the content itself.  This way, systems interacting with our websites can extract semantic meaning while still allowing for a great deal of freedom in how that content is presented.</p>\n\n<p>Moreover, Microformats are designed to capture a wide range of different types of content and social interactions, so that we can post a like or a reshare right to our own websites in a way that other services can understand (I’ll get back to this in a bit).</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately, while off-the-shelf support for Microformats is appearing in various places, it’s still somewhat nascent.</p>\n\n<p>For example, the out-of-the-box Minima theme that ships with Jekyll supports basic Microformats, but is missing quite a few things (e.g. a proper h-card including “rel=me” attributes on social media links, among many other things).  Wordpress, by contrast, has some support in the form of <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://wordpress.org/plugins/tags/microformats/\">plugins</a> and other tools, but it’s not a first-class feature, and can only be fully done by updating themes, which represents a non-trivial barrier to entry.</p>\n\n<p>In my experience this is probably the most difficult part of self-hosting an IndieWeb site at this point.  Microformats can be tricky to implement, and there’s still a lot of work being done to standardize things.  Unfortunately, Microformats are also a critical part of the IndieWeb infrastructure, and it’s my view that simplifying their adoption will be critical to the IndieWeb thriving.</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"interacting-with-social-media\">Interacting with social media</h1>\n\n<p>Breaking the monopolies of the social media giants isn’t going to happen overnight, assuming it ever happens at all.  The personal website or blog is a time-tested method of taking back control of our content and our identities, but what do we do about all those friends and family who stubbornly stick to established social media platforms?</p>\n\n<p>The IndieWeb has a simple solution:  publish the content on your own personal website or blog, but then syndicate the content to those platforms.  In the IndieWeb this methodology is called <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://indieweb.org/POSSE\">“Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere”</a>, or POSSE for short.</p>\n\n<p>Now, anyone who runs a blog is already very familiar with this pattern.  My wife, Lenore, has been manually syndicating content from her blog (<a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://blog.b-ark.ca/celebrityreaders.com/\">celebrityreaders.com</a>) to her Facebook page for years.  She just didn’t have a name for it.  The trouble is:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Established techniques are often manual, which is a huge pain.</li>\n  <li>There was no way to pull social interactions back from those platforms to your personal website.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://brid.gy/\">Brid.gy</a> provides a solution for this for a number of platforms<sup id=\"fnref:2\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html#fn:2\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">2</a></sup>, including Instagram and Twitter, by using IndieWeb technologies (including Microformats and Webmention, which I’ll get to in a second) to support automated, two-way linking between personal websites and social media accounts;<sup id=\"fnref:3\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">3</a></sup> two-way in that Brid.gy can both automate the syndication of content from your personal website to various platforms, and can also pull back likes, replies, and other social interactions (what the IndieWeb refers to as a <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://indieweb.org/backfeed\">backfeed</a>) from those platforms.</p>\n\n<p>Now, I’ll be the first to admit this is far from perfect.

Conversely, if I don’t think the interaction is that important to preserve or broadcast, I’ll often directly engage with the platform.</p>\n\n<p>In this way, I gain all of the benefits of those social media platforms while having the choice to retain control over my content when it matters.</p>\n\n<p>This isn’t how you break the monopolies of the social media giants, but my integration with the IndieWeb isn’t really a political statement, it’s a practical one!</p>\n\n<h1 id=\"interacting-without-social-media\">Interacting without social media</h1>\n\n<p>Okay, so there’s all these personal websites and blogs out there, but how do we go about interacting with one another <strong>without</strong> a social media platform of some kind?</p>\n\n<p>This is where a W3C standard called <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://webmention.net/\">Webmention</a> fits together with Microformats to give us a very elegant solution.</p>\n\n<p>Webmention is an extremely simple mechanism for one website or page to ping another website or page to say “Hey!

The service works roughly as follows:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>First, you either create a hosted blog on the service <strong>OR</strong> integrate an existing personal website that’s being hosted elsewhere.\n    <ol>\n      <li>The former costs a bit of money (currently $5 a month), while the latter is free.

This basically eliminates the barrier of entry.</p>\n\n<p>The timeline and curated discovery feeds make it possible for people to find each other and begin to interact.<sup id=\"fnref:5\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">5</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Finally, first-class support for POSSE and backfeeds to/from platforms like Facebook and Twitter makes it easier to move to the platform without completely losing contact with all those folks on social media.<sup id=\"fnref:6\" role=\"doc-noteref\"><a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\" rel=\"footnote\">6</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Now, that’s not to say there aren’t downsides!  The most obvious is that, again, posting to a service you don’t control means the content is fundamentally not in your control.  However, the reliance on open technologies and formats means that:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Your content is portable; you can take it with you if you want.</li>\n  <li>Micro.blog plays well with the rest of the IndieWeb.  Just because you host on Micro.blog, doesn’t mean I have to, and vice versa.</li>\n  <li>If you decide you want to leave Micro.blog and host elsewhere, you don’t have to sever your connection with the Micro.blog community or the IndieWeb at large.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h1 id=\"whats-next-for-the-indieweb\">What’s next for the IndieWeb?</h1>\n\n<p>This post is long enough, so I think I’ll reserve this topic for another day.  But here’s some food for thought.</p>\n\n<p>First, I think we need to continue to push the benefits of personal websites and how the IndieWeb is making it possible to run one while still enjoying all the benefits of traditional social media.  The <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://indieweb.org/\">IndieWeb</a> landing page does a good job of laying out the fundamentals, but we need to connect those benefits to people’s real-life pain points so they see the IndieWeb as a solution to their actual, real-life problems.</p>\n\n<p>This is why this post began with what I think is an often overlooked benefit of personal websites:  simplifying data collection, archiving, and preservation.</p>\n\n<p>Second, we need to continue to reduce barriers of entry so more people can be drawn into the still-nascent IndieWeb community.  I’m imagining something like a simple, canned blogging platform, built on something like <a href=\"https://blog.b-ark.ca/2019/12/22/indiewebbing.html/https://solid.inrupt.com/\">SOLID</a>, running on commodity cloud infrastructure, so people can own the data and the service without needing the technical expertise to actually operate the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Third, we need to make syndication and interaction with social media platforms as simple and fool-proof as possible.  The IndieWeb vs social media cannot be an either-or choice if we expect people to give it a try.</p>\n\n<p>I’m also personally very interested in the topic of content discovery and curation.  I feel like there’s some exciting opportunities in the space of algorithmic curation that could enable content discovery while avoiding the evils of things like the Facebook news feed.</p>\n\n<p>But with the shine now coming off the major tech giants, laws like GDPR and CCPA being passed, and people beginning to realize the issues with social media as its currently conceived, I feel like there’s a real opportunity to create alternatives that connect people while allowing them to retain control over their identities online.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\">\n  <ol>\n    <li id=\"fn:1\" role=\"doc-endnote\">\n      <p>By the way, I’ll be the first to admit this list of challenges is certainly not exhaustive, and is somewhat cherry-picked based on the kinds of issues the IndieWeb movement is trying to solve.

      "content-plain": "Our data, scattered\n\nA while back I started to take an interest in the topic of personal data archiving, and in particular how the topic intersects with the various social media platforms that so many of us interact with.  The simple fact is that so much of who we are–the things we write, the photos and videos we take, the people we interact with, our very memories, as Facebook likes to remind us–are locked up in a bunch of different walled gardens that are difficult to escape, both technically and due to the powerful social pressures that keep us on these platforms.\n\nI like to think of the traditional photo album as an interesting contrast.\n\nIt used to be that we collected memories in these books, and stored those books on a shelf.  There was some real downsides to this approach!  It’s a pain to add stuff to them (I have to “print” photos??)  They’re difficult to share and enjoy.  They’re single points of failure (think: house fires).  They require intentional acts to ensure preservation.  The list goes on.\n\nBut, they were ours.  We owned them.  We could take those photos and easily copy them, share them, rearrange them, archive them, and so forth.\n\nNow imagine that you collected all your photos in a photo album that you could only store and access from a vault being run by a private company.  The company would ensure the photos were protected and stored properly, and they provided a really nice, simple mechanism to easily add photos to your album right from your phone!  That’s really nice!  But if you wanted to look at those photos, you’d have to go to the vault, enter your passcode, and then you could only look at them while you were in the vault.  And if you wanted to get a copy of all of those photos for yourself, well, you can, but it’s ugly and complicated and designed to make it minimally possible and maximally difficult.\n\nNext, imagine the corporation changed their policies in a way you didn’t like.  Or imagine that corporation went bankrupt.  Or experienced a fire.  Or you lost the passcode for that vault.  Or a loved one passed away and didn’t store the passcode in a safe place.\n\nWhat then?\n\nToday, we don’t just lock those photos in one vault run by one private company.  We lock those photos in many vaults, spread out all over the place.  In doing so, we dramatically increase these risks, because instead of just one company failing or one account that we might lose access to or one set of terms of service we need to worry about, it’s many.\n\nAll the while we fragment our identity, spreading ourselves thin across the internet, which makes it extremely difficult to preserve all of those memories.\n\nSo what can we do about it?\n\n\n\nBuilding a social hub\n\nImagine there was a way you could carve out a space on the internet that was exclusively your own.  In this space you could decide for yourself what you wanted to broadcast to the world.  It could be a place for you to post short notes, long articles, photos, videos, book reviews, or really anything else that you wanted to share with your friends and family.  All the content could appear in one location, rather than being fractured and spread out across a dozen little places out of your control.\n\nIn this place you could carefully curate your identity.  If you want to share something, you make the choice to share it.  If you want to delete something, you make the choice to delete it.  You never have to worry about your information being taken without your consent because it’s your space.  You own it, and you control it.\n\nAnd what about all those social media walled gardens where all of your friends and family currently reside?  Well, imagine you could take the content from your personal space and selectively choose to share things on those services.  Even better, imagine you could pull the social interactions in those walled gardens back to your own space so that, no matter where they happened, they could all be collected in one place.\n\nFinally, imagine there was any easy way to interact with other personal spaces from your own, so that social interactions could happen directly rather than through those proprietary communities.\n\nIn this world, because the content is entirely under your control, there is no risk of a service going down or an account being lost.  Data collection and archiving happen automatically because the content you post is going to a single place that is a service you control.  In short:  you own your photo album again.  Except you get all those other benefits, including easy publishing, sharing, and so forth, as well.\n\nThis is the idea behind the IndieWeb, where folks are developing the tools and technologies that will allow the personal website or blog to evolve into a central social identity.\n\nChallenges with the personal website\n\nWhen contrasting the personal website to the rise of social media, it’s obvious the latter succeeded by providing a number of significant advantages1:\n\n\n  Minimizes friction for content creation.\n  Enables simple, easy, complex social interaction, including liking, sharing, etc.\n  Standardizes the presentation of content and makes it available wherever we are.\n  Connects folks together on a single platform.\n  Makes it easy to find content, through both social filtering and algorithmic recommendation.\n  Requires no technical expertise to get involved.  Just sign up and go.\n\n\nBy contrast, when looking at blogs or personal websites, you find:\n\n\n  Content authoring and social interaction has gone mobile, with an emphasis on short-form content, photos, videos, etc, while blogs have typically been reserved for higher-effort, long-form publishing.\n  Personal websites aren’t well-connected; sharing, liking, commenting, and so forth, is difficult across the distributed web.\n  Personal websites are varied and disparate, making interoperability a challenge.\n  Our contacts on social media won’t follow us to our websites if we leave.\n  Curation and content discovery are a significant challenge in the distributed web.\n  Building and maintaining a personal website can be technically challenging and, for most, is not worth the trouble.\n\n\nThe folks behind the IndieWeb movement are trying to tackle these various issues through a mix of technology and recommended best practices.\n\nNow, to be clear, there’s still a ton of work to do, and the barrier to entry is still very high.  But there is progress being made that leads me to be slightly optimistic that the IndieWeb can, if not completely replace social media, at least provide a viable alternative for those searching for one.\n\nSimplifying content creation\n\nBecause personal websites are so varied and disparate, it’s very difficult to build clean, simple, easy-to-use applications that can reduce the barriers to content creation.\n\nThe first step in solving this issue is to create a lingua franca that clients and websites can use to talk to each other.  The IndieWeb proposes the W3C draft standard Micropub protocol as the solution.\n\nMicropub is an extremely simple, lightweight, flexible protocol that allows clients to talk to websites.  The protocol is so simple that I actually wrote my own, custom Micropub implementation for use with my website, just for the intellectual exercise.\n\nNow, obviously building your own Micropub endpoint is not for the feint of heart, but fortunately there are plugins for a number of common CMSes and blogging engines (including Wordpress).\n\nCombined with a Micropub client–I personally use Indigenous–it’s becoming possible to post notes, articles, photos, or other content to a personal website right from your phone as easy as it is to write a tweet or post to Facebook.\n\nDiversifying content, standardizing semantics\n\nIt’s time to break the stereotype of the blog as a place where we only post long-form content.  As my own website illustrates, it is not only possible, but exciting and freeing to post a diversity of types of content to personal websites, including short-form notes, photos, etc.\n\nEven better, since its your website, you can present that content however you like!  Do you want a single merged timeline?  Timelines for different types of content?  Something completely different?  That’s entirely up to you to decide!\n\nHowever, this diversity of presentation does present issues when trying to encourage interaction between websites, content aggregators, and so forth.\n\nAnd this is where Microformats come in.\n\nWhere RSS and ATOM provide excellent mechanisms for broadcasting a feed of content, Microformats allow us to embed structural semantics right into the content itself.  This way, systems interacting with our websites can extract semantic meaning while still allowing for a great deal of freedom in how that content is presented.\n\nMoreover, Microformats are designed to capture a wide range of different types of content and social interactions, so that we can post a like or a reshare right to our own websites in a way that other services can understand (I’ll get back to this in a bit).\n\nUnfortunately, while off-the-shelf support for Microformats is appearing in various places, it’s still somewhat nascent.\n\nFor example, the out-of-the-box Minima theme that ships with Jekyll supports basic Microformats, but is missing quite a few things (e.g. a proper h-card including “rel=me” attributes on social media links, among many other things).  Wordpress, by contrast, has some support in the form of plugins and other tools, but it’s not a first-class feature, and can only be fully done by updating themes, which represents a non-trivial barrier to entry.\n\nIn my experience this is probably the most difficult part of self-hosting an IndieWeb site at this point.  Microformats can be tricky to implement, and there’s still a lot of work being done to standardize things.  Unfortunately, Microformats are also a critical part of the IndieWeb infrastructure, and it’s my view that simplifying their adoption will be critical to the IndieWeb thriving.\n\nInteracting with social media\n\nBreaking the monopolies of the social media giants isn’t going to happen overnight, assuming it ever happens at all.  The personal website or blog is a time-tested method of taking back control of our content and our identities, but what do we do about all those friends and family who stubbornly stick to established social media platforms?\n\nThe IndieWeb has a simple solution:  publish the content on your own personal website or blog, but then syndicate the content to those platforms.  In the IndieWeb this methodology is called “Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere”, or POSSE for short.\n\nNow, anyone who runs a blog is already very familiar with this pattern.  My wife, Lenore, has been manually syndicating content from her blog (celebrityreaders.com) to her Facebook page for years.  She just didn’t have a name for it.  The trouble is:\n\n\n  Established techniques are often manual, which is a huge pain.\n  There was no way to pull social interactions back from those platforms to your personal website.\n\n\nBrid.gy provides a solution for this for a number of platforms2, including Instagram and Twitter, by using IndieWeb technologies (including Microformats and Webmention, which I’ll get to in a second) to support automated, two-way linking between personal websites and social media accounts;3 two-way in that Brid.gy can both automate the syndication of content from your personal website to various platforms, and can also pull back likes, replies, and other social interactions (what the IndieWeb refers to as a backfeed) from those platforms.\n\nNow, I’ll be the first to admit this is far from perfect.  Replying to a tweet on my blog is easy enough, but it’s definitely more work than simply replying directly in Twitter, so do I really want to go through that effort every single time?\n\nAs a result, my own pattern is to publish content to my blog and POSSE it when it’s content I’m confident I’ll want to preserve or control:  original content of any kind, or replies or other interactions that I want folks to see on all the various platforms where I’m publishing.  Conversely, if I don’t think the interaction is that important to preserve or broadcast, I’ll often directly engage with the platform.\n\nIn this way, I gain all of the benefits of those social media platforms while having the choice to retain control over my content when it matters.\n\nThis isn’t how you break the monopolies of the social media giants, but my integration with the IndieWeb isn’t really a political statement, it’s a practical one!\n\nInteracting without social media\n\nOkay, so there’s all these personal websites and blogs out there, but how do we go about interacting with one another without a social media platform of some kind?\n\nThis is where a W3C standard called Webmention fits together with Microformats to give us a very elegant solution.\n\nWebmention is an extremely simple mechanism for one website or page to ping another website or page to say “Hey!  I mentioned you!”  Anyone who is familiar with Pingback should feel a sense of familiarity, here.\n\nThe differences are that Webmention is4:\n\n\n  A W3C standard, and as a result is well-specified and understood.\n  Simple and lightweight while still supporting rich interactions online.\n  Designed to work with Microformats to support a wide variety of interaction types.\n\n\nDigging into this last one a little bit, the IndieWeb has begun to use Microformats to standardize the structure around key content types including (but certainly not limited to) a variety of common online social interactions, such as:\n\n\n  replies\n  likes\n  reshares\n\n\nThe way this works with Webmention, then, is that:\n\n\n  The social interaction (say, a reply) is posted to your personal website.\n  A Webmention is sent from that page to the target page the post is replying to.\n  The target page then reaches back into the source page and looks for common Microformats.\n  Recognizing the page represents a reply, the target page represents the reply in their own page (by linking, pulling the content to their own site, etc).\n\n\nThis allows direct social interaction between individuals strictly through posting to personal websites or blogs!  Very cool!\n\nNow, this does require both the sending and receiving sites to support Webmentions.  Fortunately, there are, again, loads of CMSes or CMS plugins that add support for Webmentions to existing blogs.\n\nBut for truly rich interactions, Microformat support is absolutely required, and as I mentioned previously, that currently represents a non-trivial barrier to entry.\n\nRe-inventing social media\n\nTo me, the most exciting opportunities in the IndieWeb community aren’t in getting more people building their own personal websites supporting microformats, webmentions, and so forth (though I’d be thrilled if that happened!)  For me, the really interesting challenges are creating solutions that:\n\n\n  Offer simple, out-of-the-box solutions that allow individuals with no technical expertise to participate in the IndieWeb with as little friction as possible.\n  Enable those solutions to integrate easily with major social media platforms in order to break down the network effects that prevent people from leaving.\n  Simplify the stitching together of these personal websites, using IndieWeb technologies, to enable low friction content discovery, curation, recommendation, and social interaction completely outside the existing social media ecosystem.\n\n\nThe first probably doesn’t require a lot of exposition.  The simple fact is the IndieWeb is still technically intimidating.  Starting up a blog has always been a bit of a challenge (hence the Bloggers and Tumblrs of the world), and the IndieWeb layers on a bunch of new, still-developing technical solutions that are not for the faint of heart.\n\nThe obvious solution is a new service that simplifies the creation of personal websites, while using open standards and technologies so that individuals can take their content elsewhere if they want to.  Yes, this solution isn’t perfect–any such platform has the potential for abuse, and places our content out of our direct control–but the reality is most folks do not want to run their own blogging platform, and that’s okay!\n\nThe second issue is primarily technical.  The biggest challenge is in social media platforms that don’t offer the APIs necessary to easily push/pull content to/from those platforms (I’m looking at you, Facebook).\n\nThe third issue is much more interesting to me.  Google Reader, in many ways, hinted at a direction:  enable people to publish on their personal websites, but supply a service that pulls that content into a discoverable feed while layering in social interaction features.\n\nFor example, you could imagine using a combination of RSS and Microformats to pull content from distributed personal websites into a combined feed, layering in content curation and recommendation, and using Webmentions to support comments or other interactions between that feed and the originating sites.\n\nAlright, you can stop shouting micro.blog, now!\n\nTo me, micro.blog is a really interesting experiment in a new generation of social media.  The service works roughly as follows:\n\n\n  First, you either create a hosted blog on the service OR integrate an existing personal website that’s being hosted elsewhere.\n    \n      The former costs a bit of money (currently $5 a month), while the latter is free.  However, hosting means Micro.blog takes care of everything, and ensures your blog is fully IndieWeb-enabled.\n    \n  \n  People can follow each other on the service, just like Twitter or Facebook.\n  Content from the people you follow is pulled into a unified timeline view.\n  You can like or reply to content right in the service, from either the website or an app on your phone.\n  If you’re hosting your own website, social interactions are sent back via Webmention; you’re not trapped in the service.\n  Syndication and backfeed with social media platforms is built right into the service, and that includes publishing to Facebook, Twitter, and so forth.\n\n\nSo, how does this help us?\n\nWell, the hosted version of Micro.blog allows people to quickly stand up a new blog and begin posting immediately while fully supporting Webmention, Microformats, and other IndieWeb technologies.  This basically eliminates the barrier of entry.\n\nThe timeline and curated discovery feeds make it possible for people to find each other and begin to interact.5\n\nFinally, first-class support for POSSE and backfeeds to/from platforms like Facebook and Twitter makes it easier to move to the platform without completely losing contact with all those folks on social media.6\n\nNow, that’s not to say there aren’t downsides!  The most obvious is that, again, posting to a service you don’t control means the content is fundamentally not in your control.  However, the reliance on open technologies and formats means that:\n\n\n  Your content is portable; you can take it with you if you want.\n  Micro.blog plays well with the rest of the IndieWeb.  Just because you host on Micro.blog, doesn’t mean I have to, and vice versa.\n  If you decide you want to leave Micro.blog and host elsewhere, you don’t have to sever your connection with the Micro.blog community or the IndieWeb at large.\n\n\nWhat’s next for the IndieWeb?\n\nThis post is long enough, so I think I’ll reserve this topic for another day.  But here’s some food for thought.\n\nFirst, I think we need to continue to push the benefits of personal websites and how the IndieWeb is making it possible to run one while still enjoying all the benefits of traditional social media.  The IndieWeb landing page does a good job of laying out the fundamentals, but we need to connect those benefits to people’s real-life pain points so they see the IndieWeb as a solution to their actual, real-life problems.\n\nThis is why this post began with what I think is an often overlooked benefit of personal websites:  simplifying data collection, archiving, and preservation.\n\nSecond, we need to continue to reduce barriers of entry so more people can be drawn into the still-nascent IndieWeb community.  I’m imagining something like a simple, canned blogging platform, built on something like SOLID, running on commodity cloud infrastructure, so people can own the data and the service without needing the technical expertise to actually operate the platform.\n\nThird, we need to make syndication and interaction with social media platforms as simple and fool-proof as possible.  The IndieWeb vs social media cannot be an either-or choice if we expect people to give it a try.\n\nI’m also personally very interested in the topic of content discovery and curation.  I feel like there’s some exciting opportunities in the space of algorithmic curation that could enable content discovery while avoiding the evils of things like the Facebook news feed.\n\nBut with the shine now coming off the major tech giants, laws like GDPR and CCPA being passed, and people beginning to realize the issues with social media as its currently conceived, I feel like there’s a real opportunity to create alternatives that connect people while allowing them to retain control over their identities online.\n\n\n  \n    \n      By the way, I’ll be the first to admit this list of challenges is certainly not exhaustive, and is somewhat cherry-picked based on the kinds of issues the IndieWeb movement is trying to solve.  But I do think it’s a fairly honestly list of major benefits of traditional social media. ↩\n    \n    \n      You’ll note Facebook isn’t on the list.  As a perfect illustration of the dangers of closed platforms, Facebook’s APIs make it extremely difficult to syndicate content to Facebook accounts or pull back social interaction information.  As a result, Brid.gy had to shut down their Facebook integration. ↩\n    \n    \n      It’s entirely possible you found this blog post through an automatically syndicated link published to Twitter! ↩\n    \n    \n      From the IndieWeb Webmention FAQ ↩\n    \n    \n      In my opinion this is the area where Micro.blog can probably do the most, as today discovery is a real challenge, and curation is currently done by hand, which won’t scale in the long term. ↩\n    \n    \n      This isn’t perfect.  If you have friends on Twitter, their Twitter posts aren’t gonna show up in Micro.blog.  But at least your content will still show up in Twitter. ↩",

      "content": "<p>This post will show you step by step how you can let people log in to your website with their own IndieAuth website so you don't need to worry about user accounts or passwords.</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is IndieAuth?</strong> IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.</p>\n\n<p>You can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://aaronparecki.com/2018/07/07/7/oauth-for-the-open-web\">OAuth for the Open Web</a>.</p>\n\n<h2>What You'll Need</h2>\n\n<p>You'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>An HTTP client.</li>\n<li>A URL parsing library.</li>\n<li>A hashing library that supports SHA256.</li>\n<li>A library to find <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags in HTML.</li>\n<li>The ability to show an HTML form to the user.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>IndieAuth Flow Summary</h2>\n\n<p>Here is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Present a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address.</li>\n<li>Fetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server.</li>\n<li>Redirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string.</li>\n<li>Wait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string.</li>\n<li>Exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Step by Step</h2>\n\n<p>Let's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org/\">read the spec</a> to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.</p>\n\n<h3>Show the Sign-In Form</h3>\n\n<p>First you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <code>&lt;input type=\"url\"&gt;</code>. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.</p>\n\n<p>To improve the user experience, you should <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://aaronparecki.com/2018/06/03/4/url-form-field\">add some JavaScript</a> to automatically add the <code>https://</code> scheme if the user doesn't type it in.</p>\n\n<p>The form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"html\">&lt;form action=\"/indieauth/start\" method=\"post\"&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"url\" name=\"url\" placeholder=\"example.com\"&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign In\"&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.</p>\n\n<h3>Discover the IndieAuth Server</h3>\n\n<p>There are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.</p>\n\n<p>The authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://micropub.net\">Micropub</a>, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.</p>\n\n<p>To find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org#url-canonicalization\">validating and normalizing</a> it first) and look for <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <code>&lt;link rel=\"authorization_endpoint\" href=\"...\"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel=\"token_endpoint\" href=\"...\"&gt;</code> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://indieweb.org/link_rel_parser\">link rel parser</a> library to find these URLs.</p>\n\n<h3>Start the Flow by Redirecting the User</h3>\n\n<p>Now you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.</p>\n\n<p>You'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>response_type=code</code> - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow.</li>\n<li><code>client_id=</code> - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to.</li>\n<li><code>redirect_uri=</code> - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the <code>client_id</code> value.</li>\n<li><code>state=</code> - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the <code>state</code> parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app.</li>\n<li><code>code_challenge=</code> - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below.</li>\n<li><code>code_challenge_method=S256</code> - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short.</li>\n<li><code>me=</code> - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server.</li>\n<li><code>scope=profile</code> - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either <code>profile</code> or <code>profile email</code>. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as <code>profile+email</code> or <code>profile%20email</code>.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Calculating the Code Challenge</strong></p>\n\n<p>The Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org#authorization-request\">in the spec</a>, but the summary is:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Create a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long</li>\n<li>Calculate the SHA256 hash of the string</li>\n<li>Base64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.</p>\n\n<p>Once you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is <code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize</code> because their website is <code>https://indieauth.rocks</code>, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:</p>\n\n<pre><code>https://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code\n  &amp;client_id=https://example-app.com\n  &amp;redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect\n  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53\n  &amp;code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc\n  &amp;code_challenge_method=S256\n  &amp;me=https://indieauth.rocks\n  &amp;scope=profile\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Note: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.</p>\n\n<p>Now you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.</p>\n\n<h3>Handle the Redirect Back</h3>\n\n<p>You won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the <code>redirect_uri</code> you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: <code>code</code> and <code>state</code>. For example:</p>\n\n<pre><code>https://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa\n  &amp;state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>First you need to double check that the <code>state</code> value in the redirect matches the <code>state</code> value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.</p>\n\n<h3>Exchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info</h3>\n\n<p>Now you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>grant_type=authorization_code</code></li>\n<li><code>code=</code> - The authorization code as received in the redirect.</li>\n<li><code>client_id=</code> - The same <code>client_id</code> as was used in the original request.</li>\n<li><code>redirect_uri=</code> The same <code>redirect_uri</code> as was used in the original request.</li>\n<li><code>code_verifier=</code> The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This is described in additional detail <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org#redeeming-the-authorization-code\">in the spec</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Assuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:</p>\n\n<pre><code>{\n  \"me\": \"https://indieauth.rocks/\",\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"name\": \"IndieAuth Rocks\",\n    \"url\": https://indieauth.rocks/\"\n    \"photo\": \"https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Wait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>The information under the <code>profile</code> object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the <code>profile.url</code> field or <code>profile.email</code> field.</li>\n<li>If the <code>me</code> URL is not an <strong>exact match</strong> of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the <code>me</code> URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>You can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the <code>me</code> URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.</p>\n\n<p>This last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/2021/04/13/26/indieauth/https://indieauth.spec.indieweb.org#authorization-server-confirmation\">in the spec</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Now you're done!</p>\n\n<p>The <code>me</code> URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the <code>profile</code> object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information.

      "content-plain": "This post will show you step by step how you can let people log in to your website with their own IndieAuth website so you don't need to worry about user accounts or passwords.\n\nWhat is IndieAuth? IndieAuth is an extension of OAuth 2.0 that enables an individual website like someone's WordPress, Gitea or OwnCast instance to become its own identity provider. This means you can use your own website to sign in to other websites that support IndieAuth.\n\nYou can learn more about the differences between IndieAuth and OAuth by reading OAuth for the Open Web.\n\nWhat You'll Need\n\nYou'll need a few tools and libraries to sign users in with IndieAuth.\n\n\nAn HTTP client.\nA URL parsing library.\nA hashing library that supports SHA256.\nA library to find <link> tags in HTML.\nThe ability to show an HTML form to the user.\n\n\nIndieAuth Flow Summary\n\nHere is a summary of the steps to let people sign in to your website with IndieAuth. We'll dive deeper into each step later in this post.\n\n\nPresent a sign-in form asking the user to enter their server address.\nFetch the URL to discover their IndieAuth server.\nRedirect them to their IndieAuth server with the details of your sign-in request in the query string.\nWait for the user to be redirected back to your website with an authorization code in the query string.\nExchange the authorization code for the user's profile information by making an HTTP request to their IndieAuth server.\n\n\nStep by Step\n\nLet's dive into the details of each step of the flow. While this is meant to be an approachable guide to IndieAuth, eventually you'll want to make sure to read the spec to make sure you're handling all the edge cases you might encounter properly.\n\nShow the Sign-In Form\n\nFirst you'll need to ask the user to enter their server address. You should show a form with a single HTML field, <input type=\"url\">. You need to know at least the server name of the user's website.\n\nTo improve the user experience, you should add some JavaScript to automatically add the https:// scheme if the user doesn't type it in.\n\nThe form should submit to a route on your website that will start the flow. Here's a complete example of an IndieAuth sign-in form.\n\n<form action=\"/indieauth/start\" method=\"post\">\n  <input type=\"url\" name=\"url\" placeholder=\"example.com\">\n  <br>\n  <input type=\"submit\" value=\"Sign In\">\n</form>\n\n\nWhen the user submits this form, you'll start with the URL they enter and you're ready to begin the IndieAuth flow.\n\nDiscover the IndieAuth Server\n\nThere are potentially two URLs you'll need to find at the URL the user entered in order to complete the flow: the authorization endpoint and token endpoint.\n\nThe authorization endpoint is where you'll redirect the user to so they can sign in and approve the request. Eventually they'll be redirected back to your app with an authorization code in the query string. You can take that authorization code and exchange it for their profile information. If your app wanted to read or write additional data from their website, such as when creating posts using Micropub, it could exchange that code at the second endpoint (the token endpoint) to get an access token.\n\nTo find these endpoints, you'll fetch the URL the user entered (after validating and normalizing it first) and look for <link> tags on the web page. Specifically, you'll be looking for <link rel=\"authorization_endpoint\" href=\"...\"> and <link rel=\"token_endpoint\" href=\"...\"> to find the endpoints you need for the flow. You'll want to use an HTML parser or a link rel parser library to find these URLs.\n\nStart the Flow by Redirecting the User\n\nNow you're ready to send the user to their IndieAuth server to have them log in and approve your request.\n\nYou'll need to take the authorization endpoint you discovered in the previous request and add a bunch of parameters to the query string, then redirect the user to that URL. Here is the list of parameters to add to the query string:\n\n\nresponse_type=code - This tells the server you are doing an IndieAuth authorization code flow.\nclient_id= - Set this value to the home page of your website the user is signing in to.\nredirect_uri= - This is the URL where you want the user to be returned to after they log in and approve the request. It should have the same domain name as the client_id value.\nstate= - Before starting this step, you should generate a random value for the state parameter and store it in a session and include it in the request. This is for CSRF protection for your app.\ncode_challenge= - This is the base64-urlencoded SHA256 hash of a random string you will generate. We'll cover this in more detail below.\ncode_challenge_method=S256 - This tells the server which hashing method you used, which will be SHA256 or S256 for short.\nme= - (optional) You can provide the URL the user entered in your sign-in form as a parameter here which can be a hint to some IndieAuth servers that support multiple users per server.\nscope=profile - (optional) If you want to request the user's profile information such as their name, photo, or email, include the scope parameter in the request. The value of the scope parameter can be either profile or profile email. (Make sure to URL-encode the value when including it in a URL, so it will end up as profile+email or profile%20email.)\n\n\nCalculating the Code Challenge\n\nThe Code Challenge is a hash of a secret (called the Code Verifier) that you generate before redirecting the user. This lets the server know that the thing that will later make the request for the user's profile information is the same thing that started the flow. You can see the full details of how to create this parameter in the spec, but the summary is:\n\n\nCreate a random string (called the Code Verifier) between 43-128 characters long\nCalculate the SHA256 hash of the string\nBase64-URL encode the hash to create the Code Challenge\n\n\nThe part that people most often make a mistake with is the Base64-URL encoding. Make sure you are encoding the raw hash value, not a hex representation of the hash like some hashing libraries will return.\n\nOnce you're ready with all these values, add them all to the query string of the authorization endpoint you previously discovered. For example if the user's authorization endpoint is https://indieauth.rocks/authorize because their website is https://indieauth.rocks, then you'd add these parameters to the query string to create a URL like:\n\nhttps://indieauth.rocks/authorize?response_type=code\n  &client_id=https://example-app.com\n  &redirect_uri=https://example-app.com/redirect\n  &state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53\n  &code_challenge=eBKnGb9SEoqsi0RGBv00dsvFDzJNQOyomi6LE87RVSc\n  &code_challenge_method=S256\n  &me=https://indieauth.rocks\n  &scope=profile\n\n\nNote: The user's authorization endpoint might not be on the same domain as the URL they entered. That's okay! That just means they have delegated their IndieAuth handling to an external service.\n\nNow you can redirect the user to this URL so that they can approve this request at their own IndieAuth server.\n\nHandle the Redirect Back\n\nYou won't see the user again until after they've logged in to their website and approved the request. Eventually the IndieAuth server will redirect the user back to the redirect_uri you provided in the authorization request. The authorization server will add two query parameters to the redirect: code and state. For example:\n\nhttps://example-app.com/redirect?code=af79b83817b317afc9aa\n  &state=a46a0b27e67c0cb53\n\n\nFirst you need to double check that the state value in the redirect matches the state value that you included in the initial request. This is a CSRF protection mechanism. Assuming they match, you're ready to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information.\n\nExchange the Authorization Code for the User's Profile Info\n\nNow you'll need to make a POST request to exchange the authorization code for the user's profile information. Since this code was returned in a redirect, the IndieAuth server needs an extra confirmation that it was sent back to the right thing, which is what the Code Verifier and Code Challenge are for. You'll make a POST request to the authorization endpoint with the following parameters:\n\n\ngrant_type=authorization_code\ncode= - The authorization code as received in the redirect.\nclient_id= - The same client_id as was used in the original request.\nredirect_uri= The same redirect_uri as was used in the original request.\ncode_verifier= The original random string you generated when calculating the Code Challenge.\n\n\nThis is described in additional detail in the spec.\n\nAssuming everything checks out, the IndieAuth server will respond with the full URL of the user, as well as their stated profile information if requested. The response will look like the below:\n\n{\n  \"me\": \"https://indieauth.rocks/\",\n  \"profile\": {\n    \"name\": \"IndieAuth Rocks\",\n    \"url\": https://indieauth.rocks/\"\n    \"photo\": \"https://indieauth.rocks/profile.jpg\"\n  }\n}\n\n\nWait! We're not done yet! Just because you get information in this response doesn't necessarily mean you can trust it yet! There are two important points here:\n\n\nThe information under the profile object must ALWAYS be treated as user-supplied data, not treated as canonical or authoritative in any way. This means for example not de-duping users based on the profile.url field or profile.email field.\nIf the me URL is not an exact match of the URL the user initially entered, you need to re-discover the authorization endpoint of the me URL returned in this response and make sure it matches exactly the authorization server you found in the initial discovery step.\n\n\nYou can perform the same discovery step as in the beginning, but this time using the me URL returned in the authorization code response. If that authorization endpoint matches the same authorization endpoint that you used when you started the flow, everything is fine and you can treat this response as valid.\n\nThis last validation step is critical, since without it, anyone could set up an authorization endpoint claiming to be anyone else's server. More details are available in the spec.\n\nNow you're done!\n\nThe me URL is the value you should use as the canonical and stable identifier for this user. You can use the information in the profile object to augment this user account with information like the user's name or profile information. If the user logs in again later, look up the user from their me URL and update their name/photo/email with the most recent values in the profile object to keep their profile up to date.\n\nTesting Your IndieAuth Client\n\nTo test your IndieAuth client, you'll need to find a handful of IndieAuth providers in the wild you can use to sign in to it. Here are some to get you started:\n\n\nMicro.blog - All micro.blog accounts are IndieAuth identities as well. You can use a free account for testing.\nWordPress - With the IndieAuth plugin installed, a WordPress site can be its own IndieAuth server as well.\nDrupal - The IndieWeb module for Drupal will let a Drupal instance be its own IndieAuth server.\nSelfauth - Selfauth is a single PHP file that acts as an IndieAuth server.\n\n\nEventually I will get around to finishing the test suite at indieauth.rocks so that you have a testing tool readily available, but in the mean time the options above should be enough to get you started.\n\nGetting Help\n\nIf you get stuck or need help, feel free to drop by the IndieWeb chat to ask questions!

This post is about what I did and how.</p>\n<img src=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://hiddedevries.nl/perch/resources/screenshot-1.png\" alt=\"Screenshot\"> \n<h2>Why export?</h2>\n<p>First, I quite like Goodreads. It lets me see the reads of friends and acquaintances. It lets me share my own. This is all splendid, but it is still somebody else’s site. Somebody with very different life goals from my own, in fact. For more control on what I display and how, I decided to create a new section of this website dedicated to books, fed by an export of my Goodreads data.</p>\n<p>The two main reasons I use Goodreads are people and books. I want to connect with (internet) friends and be inspired by what they read. I also want to keep track of what I have read and plan to read, for instance when a person or article mentions an interesting book. When I’m reading a book review in the paper, I’l sometimes grab my phone and add the thing to the list. Goodreads has an easy to use catalog that usually lists what I searched.</p>\n<p>Some things to dislike about the platform are the gamification and the generic recommendations: it’s noise that I could do without (“you read something in philosophy, maybe you’ll like this book by Plato”). There are also lots of trackers, and it is powered by a faceless multi-billion dollar enterprise that threatens the livelihood of friendly, local bookshops.</p>\n<h2>Some features</h2>\n<p>Various people’s online bookshelves inspired me to create one on this site, including <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://highlights.melanie-richards.com/\">Melanie Richard’s highlights</a>, focused on highlights, <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://daverupert.com/bookshelf\">Dave Rupert’s Bookshelf</a>, which features many short reviews and half stars, <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://macwright.com/reading/\">Tom McWright</a>’s, <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://maggieappleton.com/library\">Maggie Appleton</a>’s, <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/\">Mandy Brown</a>’s, <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://books.alexwlchan.net/\">Alex Chan</a>’s, <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://highlights.sawyerh.com/\">Sawyer Hollenshead</a> (also with highlights) and <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://amandapinsker.com/reading\">Amanda Pinkster</a> (includes where she read them).</p>\n<p>I like the processes of other people: <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://katydecorah.com/code/read/\">Katy Decorah uses GitHub actions</a>,  <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://what.pm/\">Nienke uses her own What.pm</a> and <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://adactio.com/journal/17596\">Jeremy Keith tags notes with ISBN numbers</a>. My process is still different from each of them though, for no particular reason.</p>\n<p>For me, a personal book repository does not require a lot, but these are some features I wanted to have: </p>\n<dl>\n<dt><strong>Separate views for Dutch and English</strong> </dt>\n<dd>I mostly read in these two languages, some viewers may only be interested in either section.</dd>\n<dt><strong>Hand-picked book covers</strong></dt>\n<dd>‘Never judge a book by its cover’, they say. Well, I like book covers as expectation setters and <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy#did-not-automate\">did not automate</a> the cover art collection process.</dd>\n<dt><strong>Links to author’s personal sites</strong></dt>\n<dd>Personal sites deliver on the promise of the web, said Matthias Ott in <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://css-tricks.com/make-it-personal/\">Make it personal</a>. I haven’t enriched a lot of the data with this piece of information, but will be.</dd>\n<dt><strong>Dark mode</strong></dt>\n<dd>Because CSS is fun. I went for a <code>midnightblue</code> background with <code>khaki</code> text.</dd>\n<dt><strong>No tracking</strong> </dt>\n<dd>This site does not track users. <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2020-03-09-minimum-viable-data-collection/\">Minimum Viable Data Collection</a> (zero, in this case) ftw.</dd>\n</dl>\n<h2>What I could automate</h2>\n<h3>CSV entries to front matter in Markdown</h3>\n<p>I decided to use <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://11ty.dev\">Eleventy</a> to turn my data into a web page, as I like its flexibility, its  focus on simplicity and its firm hesitation to make decisions for developers using it. </p>\n<p>Goodreads provides reading data in CSV files, which are reasonably well structured. For the Eleventy site, I needed a folder full of Markdown files, one for each book, with basically the metadata from the Goodreads export as <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://yaml.org/\">Yaml</a> front matter:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-yaml\">---\ntitle: \"Uncanny Valley\"\nauthor: \"Anna Wiener\"\nisbn: \"0374278016\"\nisbn13: \"9780374278014\"\nrating: \"5\"\npublisher: \"MCD\"\npages: \"281\"\npublishYear: \"2020\"\nread: \"2020\"\ngoodreads_id: \"45186565\"\n---</code></pre>\n<p>I did this in Node using a slightly modified version of <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://github.com/ninjality/convert-csv-markdown/\">CSV to Markdown</a>. The project is archived and I could not get the Noderize wrapper to work, but the provided script in <code>index.js</code> did the job for me. </p>\n<p>It seems like Hay Kranen’s <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://hay.github.io/dataknead/\">dataknead</a> may be a great alternative to do this work (in Python).</p>\n<h3>Image processing</h3>\n<p>This site has a lot of images, and resizing or optimising would not be my definition of fun. I used the official <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/image/\">Image plugin for Eleventy</a> to generate correctly sized images from my source images, and the documented Nunjucks shortcode to output a <code>picture</code> element with <code>webp</code> and <code>jpg</code> versions in various sizes. </p>\n<p>I used the native lazyloading attribute, <code>loading=\"lazy\"</code> , which I learned only in this project, is not added to the <code>picture</code>-element, but to the fallback <code>&lt;img&gt;</code>.</p>\n<h3>The grid</h3>\n<p>I knew how I wanted my content to be layed out, but I didn’t know what my content would be. Grid Layout is fantastic if that’s your situation. I used grid’s <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://www.w3.org/TR/css-grid-1#grid-item-placement-algorithm\">autoplacement</a> feature: I defined a grid, added the content in HTML and each book magically appeared in its right place.</p>\n<img alt=\"books with grid browser tools overlayed\" src=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://hiddedevries.nl/perch/resources/grid.png\"> \n<p>On small screens, I used the non-default autoflow value <code>column</code>, to make new items appear horizontally.</p>\n<h2 id=\"did-not-automate\">What I didn’t automate</h2>\n<p>In web projects, we often balance between spending time to automate versus doing it manually. Sure, automation can be a fun thing to work on. But if I’m honest, I only want to do it if it saves more time than it costs.  </p>\n<h3>Book covers</h3>\n<p>Cover art is among the highest forms of graphic design. Covers of music and books can be incredibly creative. Film posters can be a prone to <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ThnxSaExzU\">cliche overuse</a>, but have you seen <a href=\"https://hiddedevries.nl/en/blog/2021-01-04-how-i-turned-my-goodreads-data-into-a-self-hosted-website-with-eleventy/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRpGSDsu_tg\">Saul Bass’s movie posters</a>? </p>\n<p>Books often get different covers when they are reprinted or distributed in different countries.

      "content-plain": "In the last week of 2020, I decided to export my Goodreads data to display it on my personal website. This post is about what I did and how.\n Screenshot  \nWhy export?\nFirst, I quite like Goodreads. It lets me see the reads of friends and acquaintances. It lets me share my own. This is all splendid, but it is still somebody else’s site. Somebody with very different life goals from my own, in fact. For more control on what I display and how, I decided to create a new section of this website dedicated to books, fed by an export of my Goodreads data.\nThe two main reasons I use Goodreads are people and books. I want to connect with (internet) friends and be inspired by what they read. I also want to keep track of what I have read and plan to read, for instance when a person or article mentions an interesting book. When I’m reading a book review in the paper, I’l sometimes grab my phone and add the thing to the list. Goodreads has an easy to use catalog that usually lists what I searched.\nSome things to dislike about the platform are the gamification and the generic recommendations: it’s noise that I could do without (“you read something in philosophy, maybe you’ll like this book by Plato”). There are also lots of trackers, and it is powered by a faceless multi-billion dollar enterprise that threatens the livelihood of friendly, local bookshops.\nSome features\nVarious people’s online bookshelves inspired me to create one on this site, including Melanie Richard’s highlights, focused on highlights, Dave Rupert’s Bookshelf, which features many short reviews and half stars, Tom McWright’s, Maggie Appleton’s, Mandy Brown’s, Alex Chan’s, Sawyer Hollenshead (also with highlights) and Amanda Pinkster (includes where she read them).\nI like the processes of other people: Katy Decorah uses GitHub actions,  Nienke uses her own What.pm and Jeremy Keith tags notes with ISBN numbers. My process is still different from each of them though, for no particular reason.\nFor me, a personal book repository does not require a lot, but these are some features I wanted to have: \n\nSeparate views for Dutch and English \nI mostly read in these two languages, some viewers may only be interested in either section.\nHand-picked book covers\n‘Never judge a book by its cover’, they say. Well, I like book covers as expectation setters and did not automate the cover art collection process.\nLinks to author’s personal sites\nPersonal sites deliver on the promise of the web, said Matthias Ott in Make it personal. I haven’t enriched a lot of the data with this piece of information, but will be.\nDark mode\nBecause CSS is fun. I went for a midnightblue background with khaki text.\nNo tracking \nThis site does not track users. Minimum Viable Data Collection (zero, in this case) ftw.\n\nWhat I could automate\nCSV entries to front matter in Markdown\nI decided to use Eleventy to turn my data into a web page, as I like its flexibility, its  focus on simplicity and its firm hesitation to make decisions for developers using it. \nGoodreads provides reading data in CSV files, which are reasonably well structured. For the Eleventy site, I needed a folder full of Markdown files, one for each book, with basically the metadata from the Goodreads export as Yaml front matter:\n---\ntitle: \"Uncanny Valley\"\nauthor: \"Anna Wiener\"\nisbn: \"0374278016\"\nisbn13: \"9780374278014\"\nrating: \"5\"\npublisher: \"MCD\"\npages: \"281\"\npublishYear: \"2020\"\nread: \"2020\"\ngoodreads_id: \"45186565\"\n---\nI did this in Node using a slightly modified version of CSV to Markdown. The project is archived and I could not get the Noderize wrapper to work, but the provided script in index.js did the job for me. \nIt seems like Hay Kranen’s dataknead may be a great alternative to do this work (in Python).\nImage processing\nThis site has a lot of images, and resizing or optimising would not be my definition of fun. I used the official Image plugin for Eleventy to generate correctly sized images from my source images, and the documented Nunjucks shortcode to output a picture element with webp and jpg versions in various sizes. \nI used the native lazyloading attribute, loading=\"lazy\" , which I learned only in this project, is not added to the picture-element, but to the fallback <img>.\nThe grid\nI knew how I wanted my content to be layed out, but I didn’t know what my content would be. Grid Layout is fantastic if that’s your situation. I used grid’s autoplacement feature: I defined a grid, added the content in HTML and each book magically appeared in its right place.\n books with grid browser tools overlayed  \nOn small screens, I used the non-default autoflow value column, to make new items appear horizontally.\nWhat I didn’t automate\nIn web projects, we often balance between spending time to automate versus doing it manually. Sure, automation can be a fun thing to work on. But if I’m honest, I only want to do it if it saves more time than it costs.  \nBook covers\nCover art is among the highest forms of graphic design. Covers of music and books can be incredibly creative. Film posters can be a prone to cliche overuse, but have you seen Saul Bass’s movie posters? \nBooks often get different covers when they are reprinted or distributed in different countries. This project was the perfect excuse to handpick my favourite for each book.\nCSS authoring\nThere was not enough complexity to warrant any form of CSS processing, so I just created a single CSS file and started adding styles. I used no methodology or framework. I did mostly avoid classes, because in my day to day work I overuse them and it seemed like a fun challenge.\nExtra data\nI’ve also added some data manually that I didn’t have in Goodreads, like the language I read a book in. And I want to slowly add more data to some books, like the URI for the author’s personal website, and, in case I wrote a review, a link to that review.\nFuture features\nThere are some things that I would like to improve when there’s more time or less lockdown. A website is never finished! \n\nSome interface to add data\nAdding a new book now involves me manually creating a Markdown file with the right front matter and a JPG file with the same name for the book cover. I could automate at least part of this.\nFilters\nBooks can currently display by language. If I started adding tags to books, I could create sub lists, “Show books about topic X”. That would be fairly trivial to do.\nBetter sorting\nI messed up transforming the date field in the Goodreads export, so now I only have a year and no way to sort by reading date. I plan to add this for new books.\nRSS\nI doubt anyone would subscribe to something like this, but wide  availability of reading list RSS feeds would allow us all to create a decentralised Goodreads in feed reader software of our choice.\nBetter lazyloading\nCurrently, all images on the book site have the loading=\"lazy\" attribute. The recommended way is to only add this attribute for images that are not in the viewport. I’m not sure how to solve that on this site, because my grid grows with the viewport. Which images are in your viewport, depends on how wide it is.\nBetter markup\nMaybe I can use more standard markup for the books, like microformats. The indieweb personal library page has some pointers, including Paul Munday’s example of microformats for books.\n\nWoops, that’s quite the list. Let me just postpone it to the next sprint. \nWrapping up\nSo, my book site is available on books.hiddedevries.nl, the source is on GitHub. This has been a fun weekend project, and to be honest, I am very much looking forward to continue expanding the existing data and add new stuff. \nIf you have one of these digital bookshelves yourself, please do share them in the comments or reply on Twitter! If you have any thoughts or opinions on what I’ve done, feel free to let me know.",

They say that with Node.js we can create network applications, but we can do a lot more.</p><p>Bow, for example, is a very useful tool built in the top of node.js. We can take advantage of the fact of node.js be cross-platform to create CLI apps which can serve &nbsp;everyone.</p><p>CLI applications can be very useful to task automation, to do repetitive tasks we do everyday, etc. Bower, that I’ve already mentioned, is useful because it installs and updates all of the front-end dependencies automatically.</p><p>So, the purpose of this article is helping you creating a command-line interface application with node.js.</p><h2 id=\"is-everything-ok\">Is everything ok?</h2><p>To begin, you should have both node.js and npm installed on your computer. The current versions of node.js already have npm build-in. Npm is the official node package manager.</p><p>You can download node.js from this website. After installed, you should check if the node.js and npm are correctly installed on your computer. To do that, you can, for example, run the following commands to see the current installed version of each thing:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; node --version\n&gt; npm --version\n</code></pre><p>If both commands return something like v0.12.0 and 2.5.1, everything is ready to be used.</p><h2 id=\"initialize-thepackage\">Initialize the&nbsp;package</h2><p>Now, let’s create our first node.js command-line&nbsp;application with node.js. First of all, go the directory where you want to save the code of the application. Run the following commands:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; mkdir mycliapp\n&gt; cd mycliapp\n</code></pre><p>Of course you can replace mycliapp&nbsp;&nbsp;with whatever you want.&nbsp;Now, we have to create a <code>package.json</code>&nbsp;file which contains the <a href=\"https://hacdias.com/articles/2015/03/how-to-create-a-node-js-command-line-application/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">meta information</a> of the application. It can be done automatically:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; npm init\n</code></pre><p>After running the previous command, you should put the information you want for the package. If the information between parentheses is correct, you just have to press enter.</p><p>Now, you should have something like this:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"name\": \"mycliapp\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"description\": \"This is my first cli application.\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" &amp;&amp; exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"Henrique Dias &lt;mail@hacdias.com&gt; (http://henriquedias.com)\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\n</code></pre><p>I think almost all of the content of that file is self-explanatory. If you have some doubt, search in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hacdias.com/articles/2015/03/how-to-create-a-node-js-command-line-application/https://docs.npmjs.com/files/package.json\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">this page</a>. Right now, we are going to ignore the <code>index.js</code>&nbsp;file.</p><p>Now, and because it is a command-line application, we should add two other informations to the <code>package.json</code>&nbsp;file:</p><pre><code class=\"language-json\">{\n  \"preferGlobal\": true,\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"mycliapp\": \"./bin/mycliapp\"\n  }\n}\n</code></pre><p>The first one (preferGlobal&nbsp;) that advises the user that this app should be installed globally, it means, available in the all system.</p><p>The second one, bin&nbsp;, is used to tell the commands which will be available to use. In this example we have the command <code>mycliapp</code> associated with the file located at&nbsp;<code>bin/mycliapp.js</code>.</p><h2 id=\"output-some-data\">Output some data</h2><p>Then we are going to create the <code>bin/mycliapp.js</code>&nbsp;file which will have all of the application logic (in this case, it can be divided into various files). Create it, and simply add the following code to print an Hello World:</p><pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">#! /usr/bin/env node\n\nconsole.log('Hello, World!');\n</code></pre><p>Now, link your app with npm to run it locally. Do it using this command:</p><pre><code class=\"language-bash\">&gt; npm link\n</code></pre><p>After that, you should be able to run the command <code>mycliapp</code>&nbsp;in the console.

      "content-plain": "Nowadays, node.js is one of the technologies which is always talked about when the subject is related with real-time applications or even CLI (Command-line interface) apps.Node.js is a cross-platform platform (which is very redundant) built on Chrome’s JavaScript runtime. They say that with Node.js we can create network applications, but we can do a lot more.Bow, for example, is a very useful tool built in the top of node.js. We can take advantage of the fact of node.js be cross-platform to create CLI apps which can serve  everyone.CLI applications can be very useful to task automation, to do repetitive tasks we do everyday, etc. Bower, that I’ve already mentioned, is useful because it installs and updates all of the front-end dependencies automatically.So, the purpose of this article is helping you creating a command-line interface application with node.js.Is everything ok?To begin, you should have both node.js and npm installed on your computer. The current versions of node.js already have npm build-in. Npm is the official node package manager.You can download node.js from this website. After installed, you should check if the node.js and npm are correctly installed on your computer. To do that, you can, for example, run the following commands to see the current installed version of each thing:> node --version\n> npm --version\nIf both commands return something like v0.12.0 and 2.5.1, everything is ready to be used.Initialize the packageNow, let’s create our first node.js command-line application with node.js. First of all, go the directory where you want to save the code of the application. Run the following commands:> mkdir mycliapp\n> cd mycliapp\nOf course you can replace mycliapp  with whatever you want. Now, we have to create a package.json file which contains the meta information of the application. It can be done automatically:> npm init\nAfter running the previous command, you should put the information you want for the package. If the information between parentheses is correct, you just have to press enter.Now, you should have something like this:{\n  \"name\": \"mycliapp\",\n  \"version\": \"0.0.1\",\n  \"description\": \"This is my first cli application.\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"test\": \"echo \\\"Error: no test specified\\\" && exit 1\"\n  },\n  \"author\": \"Henrique Dias <mail@hacdias.com> (http://henriquedias.com)\",\n  \"license\": \"MIT\"\n}\nI think almost all of the content of that file is self-explanatory. If you have some doubt, search in this page. Right now, we are going to ignore the index.js file.Now, and because it is a command-line application, we should add two other informations to the package.json file:{\n  \"preferGlobal\": true,\n  \"bin\": {\n    \"mycliapp\": \"./bin/mycliapp\"\n  }\n}\nThe first one (preferGlobal ) that advises the user that this app should be installed globally, it means, available in the all system.The second one, bin , is used to tell the commands which will be available to use. In this example we have the command mycliapp associated with the file located at bin/mycliapp.js.Output some dataThen we are going to create the bin/mycliapp.js file which will have all of the application logic (in this case, it can be divided into various files). Create it, and simply add the following code to print an Hello World:#! /usr/bin/env node\n\nconsole.log('Hello, World!');\nNow, link your app with npm to run it locally. Do it using this command:> npm link\nAfter that, you should be able to run the command mycliapp in the console. Run it and you should receive the message “Hello, world!”.Get data from userNow we already know how to output some information (simply using console.log()). So now we are going to learn how to get data from the user.There are some packages which help us to make question to the user, but we will use the built-in module readline which is very simple to use.Firstly, we need to include that module. To do that, we may do something like this:var rl = require('readline');\nNow, we have to create the interface to make the question, it means that we are going to set the input and output of data.var read = rl.createInterface({\n  input: process.stdin,\n  output: process.stdout\n});\nprocess (read more here) is a global object variable which is an instance of EventEmitter.So now that we already have the input and output setted up, we can make a question to the user and then receive the answer. We should use this syntax:read.question(query, callback);\nTo ask the user his name and then print it, you may do something like this:read.question(\"What is your name? \", function (answer) {\n  read.close(); // close the instance of reading interface\n  console.log(answer);\n});\nIt is very simples as you can see. Never forget to close the instance of the reading interface. After that you can do whatever you want with the answer of the user.You can get more information about this module here.How to read argumentsThere are a lot of ways to read arguments. There’s some third-party packages which helps the user doing it, like commander, but we are going to do it manually to see how does it work.Remember the process  object? It also contains the arguments. Let’s experiment. Write the following code of line in bin/mycliapp. You might remove all of the previous code or comment it.console.log(process.argv);\nNow, run the application, putting some arguments, options, commands after the app name.> mycliapp option1 henrique\n[ 'node',\n 'C:\\\\Users\\\\Henrique\\\\AppData\\\\Roaming\\\\npm\\\\node_modules\\\\mycliapp\\\\bin\\\\mycliapp',\n  'option1',\n  'henrique' ]\nSo, the first element of our arguments array is the environment, in this case, node. The second one is the path of the file which is running. The following elements are the other arguments.If you just want the arguments put by the user you may do something like this:var args = process.argv;\nargs.splice(0,2); // remove 2 elements after the position 0\nIf you print the content of args  variable you will see that it only contains the arguments that the user wrote.Now, if you want, for example, to print “Hello” when the user uses the argument sayhello , you can do this:if (args[0] === 'sayhello') {\n  console.log(\"Hello\");\n}\nSimple, but effective. Now, go on and create your CLI application with Node.js :)I hope you have enjoyed this tutorial of how to create node.js command-line applications.

finishing your boards and posts prior to assembling and simply touching up later. This will make for easier painting and will keep you from having to paint this wherever this piece will actually live (bedroom) since you will have to assemble it in the area it will be placed (at 45 or more inches wide this will not fit through a doorway after it’s assembled). ** I also recommend using Wood Filler to fill in any knots or uneven areas on your boards prior to painting if you are NOT going for a rustic look. Please also consider giving each post and board slightly rounded edges as you sand, for added comfort for your kiddos. Before beginning to build, always check in on my site to make sure you have the most up to date set of plans, I occasionally update and change the plans to make the building process easier or to allow for less expensive purchasing of materials! Read through the entire set of instructions and all comments before beginning this project. If you print out or save plans, be sure to check in on my site to be sure you have the most up to date set of plans, as I occasionally update things for ease of building or buying. If you are new to building, read through the <a href=\"https://www.thedesignconfidential.com/2010/08/build-it-plans-low-loft-bunk/http://www.thedesignconfidential.com/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">GETTING STARTED</a> section and other articles found under the <a href=\"https://www.thedesignconfidential.com/2010/08/build-it-plans-low-loft-bunk/http://www.thedesignconfidential.com/tips-and-tricks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">BUILD</a> tab in the menu on my site, it has valuable information about how to get started, tools and techniques. If you are unfamiliar with the finishing process, visit my <a href=\"https://www.thedesignconfidential.com/2010/08/build-it-plans-low-loft-bunk/http://www.thedesignconfidential.com/finishing-school\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Finishing school</a> for some tips and tricks for painting like a pro and for special finishing practices. Use glue to secure your joints and Consider Painting or Staining individual sections prior to assembling. This makes the paint application virtually flawless. Coat with a spray on Poly or Wipe on Poly to protect your finish and your piece and it will last for ages. Adhere to all safety standards and guidelines, and be sure you follow safety protocol throughout your build. If you are unsure about whether you are building safely, run a quick online search for the tool or technique you are using, or contact me via email or post to the forum before you move ahead.

This will make for easier painting and will keep you from having to paint this wherever this piece will actually live (bedroom) since you will have to assemble it in the area it will be placed (at 45 or more inches wide this will not fit through a doorway after it’s assembled). ** I also recommend using Wood Filler to fill in any knots or uneven areas on your boards prior to painting if you are NOT going for a rustic look. Please also consider giving each post and board slightly rounded edges as you sand, for added comfort for your kiddos. Before beginning to build, always check in on my site to make sure you have the most up to date set of plans, I occasionally update and change the plans to make the building process easier or to allow for less expensive purchasing of materials! Read through the entire set of instructions and all comments before beginning this project. If you print out or save plans, be sure to check in on my site to be sure you have the most up to date set of plans, as I occasionally update things for ease of building or buying. If you are new to building, read through the GETTING STARTED section and other articles found under the BUILD tab in the menu on my site, it has valuable information about how to get started, tools and techniques. If you are unfamiliar with the finishing process, visit my Finishing school for some tips and tricks for painting like a pro and for special finishing practices. Use glue to secure your joints and Consider Painting or Staining individual sections prior to assembling. This makes the paint application virtually flawless. Coat with a spray on Poly or Wipe on Poly to protect your finish and your piece and it will last for ages. Adhere to all safety standards and guidelines, and be sure you follow safety protocol throughout your build. If you are unsure about whether you are building safely, run a quick online search for the tool or technique you are using, or contact me via email or post to the forum before you move ahead. My contact info can be found in the menu of my site.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t The Design Confidential Free DIY Furniture Plans to Build a Twin Sized Low Loft Bunk \n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\nCut the Legs to size and attach the Cleat to the Front and Back Rails using 2″ Screws. To attach the Rails to the Legs you will arrange the 4 pieces as shown in the diagram below, making sure to leave 1 1/2″ on either side of the Rails to allow for the Side Rails later, and clamp together making sure everything is completely square before you proceed. Once square and aligned as needed, you will use a 5/16″ Drill Bit and drill through all 3 pieces on each side, creating 2 holes on either side for the bolts.

I fixed that and now do <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://robertvanbregt.nl/2020/02/01/3912/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">what Robert van Bregt suggested</a> or what <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://jan.boddez.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Jan Boddez</a> does with <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://github.com/janboddez/sync-opml-blogroll\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">his WordPress plugin</a>.</p><p>To generate my site I use a self-hosted instance of Drone CI (I already wrote about that <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://jlelse.blog/tags/drone-ci\">a few times</a>) with <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://jlel.se/dockerhugo\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">a custom Docker image</a>. That image includes Hugo (to build the site), but it also includes Go itself instead of just the Hugo binary, because Hugo modules require Go to be installed.</p><p>Because Go is already installed and I’m way more fluent in Go than in shell-scripting, I decided to write a small Go tool. First I wanted to use <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://pkg.go.dev/miniflux.app/client\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">the official Miniflux Go client</a> but it contains a lot of stuff that I don’t need and I wanted to limit the script to only use the Go standard library (so it doesn’t always need to download dependencies first – and the standard library already contains tools to parse and produce XML - OPML is XML - and JSON). The Go script gets called by a simple <code>go run tools/blogroll/blogroll.go</code>, I also didn’t want to commit any binaries to my blog’s Git repository.</p><p>You want to see the script? Here it is (at the time of this article’s publication): (<strong>Update</strong>: <a href=\"https://jlelse.blog/dev/miniflux-blogroll/https://jlelse.blog/dev/updated-miniflux-script\">I updated the

      "content-plain": "Yesterday I teased a new post about how I automated my blogroll generation by writing a Go script and using the Miniflux API. Here it is.Up until yesterday, I always updated my blogroll manually. I wrote about that process here. It was a bit of automation but not completely automated. I fixed that and now do what Robert van Bregt suggested or what Jan Boddez does with his WordPress plugin.To generate my site I use a self-hosted instance of Drone CI (I already wrote about that a few times) with a custom Docker image. That image includes Hugo (to build the site), but it also includes Go itself instead of just the Hugo binary, because Hugo modules require Go to be installed.Because Go is already installed and I’m way more fluent in Go than in shell-scripting, I decided to write a small Go tool. First I wanted to use the official Miniflux Go client but it contains a lot of stuff that I don’t need and I wanted to limit the script to only use the Go standard library (so it doesn’t always need to download dependencies first – and the standard library already contains tools to parse and produce XML - OPML is XML - and JSON). The Go script gets called by a simple go run tools/blogroll/blogroll.go, I also didn’t want to commit any binaries to my blog’s Git repository.You want to see the script? Here it is (at the time of this article’s publication): (Update: I updated the script!)package main\n\nimport (\n\t\"encoding/json\"\n\t\"encoding/xml\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"io/ioutil\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"time\"\n)\n\ntype Opml struct {\n\tBody struct {\n\t\tOpmlOutline\n\t} `xml:\"body\" json:\"body\"`\n}\n\ntype OpmlOutline struct {\n\tText     string        `xml:\"text,attr\" json:\"_text,omitempty\"`\n\tTitle    string        `xml:\"title,attr\" json:\"_title,omitempty\"`\n\tXmlUrl   string        `xml:\"xmlUrl,attr\" json:\"_xmlUrl,omitempty\"`\n\tHtmlUrl  string        `xml:\"htmlUrl,attr\" json:\"_htmlUrl,omitempty\"`\n\tOutlines []OpmlOutline `xml:\"outline\" json:\"outline,omitempty\"`\n}\n\nfunc main() {\n\n\t// Get OPML\n\tminifluxClient := http.Client{\n\t\tTimeout: time.Second * 5,\n\t}\n\treq, err := http.NewRequest(http.MethodGet, \"https://MY-MINIFLUX-DOMAIN/v1/export\", nil)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\treq.Header.Set(\"Content-Type\", \"application/json\")\n\treq.Header.Set(\"Accept\", \"application/json\")\n\treq.Header.Set(\"X-Auth-Token\", \"API-TOKEN\")\n\tres, getErr := minifluxClient.Do(req)\n\tif getErr != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\tif res.Body != nil {\n\t\tdefer func() { _ = res.Body.Close() }()\n\t}\n\tif res.StatusCode != http.StatusOK {\n\t\tfmt.Println(\"Status code: \", res.StatusCode)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\topmlBytes, err := ioutil.ReadAll(res.Body)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Unmarshal\n\topml := &Opml{}\n\terr = xml.Unmarshal(opmlBytes, opml)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Filter\n\tnewOpml := &Opml{}\n\tfor _, outline := range opml.Body.Outlines {\n\t\tif outline.Text == \"Blogs\" || outline.Text == \"Comics\" {\n\t\t\tnewOpml.Body.Outlines = append(newOpml.Body.Outlines, outline)\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Marshal as JSON\n\tjsonOpmlBytes, err := json.MarshalIndent(newOpml.Body, \"\", \"    \")\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\treturn\n\t}\n\n\t// Write to file\n\terr = ioutil.WriteFile(\"data/opml.json\", jsonOpmlBytes, 0644)\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tfmt.Println(err)\n\t\treturn\n    }\n    \n}\nMy goal was to create a data/opml.json file that was as close to the one I generated manually before. Nevertheless I had to slightly modify the blogroll Hugo shortcode from the previous post. It currently looks like this:{{ $opmlJson := index .Site.Data.opml \"outline\" }}\n{{ range $opmlJson }}\n{{ (printf \"%s %s\" \"##\" ._text) | markdownify }}\n<ul>\n    {{ range sort (index . \"outline\") \"_title\" \"asc\" }}\n    <li><a href=\"{{ ._htmlUrl }}\" target=\"_blank\">{{ ._title }}</a> (<a href=\"{{ ._xmlUrl }}\" target=\"_blank\">Feed</a>)</li>\n    {{ end }}\n</ul>\n{{ end }}\nIt now enables displaying multiple categories of feeds (“Blogs” and “Comics” in my case) and is adapted to the new JSON format.Most things (API key or filtered categories) in the Go script are hard coded, because I didn’t want to make it generic. If someone uses it or takes inspiration from my code, they would probably modify it anyway. It also made things easier. After all it’s just a simple HTTP request, parsing, filtering, and printing to a file.

I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”</p>\n\n<p>There was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.<sup id=\"fnref:3\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:3\" class=\"footnote\">2</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>However, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.</p>\n\n<p>I zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"learning-what-people-around-me-are-doing\">Learning what people around me are doing</h2>\n\n<p>Since we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.<sup id=\"fnref:15\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\">3</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Most big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.<sup id=\"fnref:1\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:1\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup> Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.</p>\n\n<p>Product managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.</p>\n\n<p>Over the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.</p>\n\n<p>For example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.</p>\n\n<!-- More recently, I got a chance to sit in on a few product scoping meetings between teams. This gave me a lot more appreciation for the job my PM and TLs do. Communication is surprisingly hard, and aligning different teams takes skill. -->\n\n<!-- Force multiplier in team vs force multiplier in the entire chain. -->\n\n<h2 id=\"learning-good-habits-of-mind\">Learning good habits of mind</h2>\n\n<p>Software engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.</p>\n\n<p>A habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.</p>\n\n<p>I suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"thinking-well\">Thinking Well</h3>\n\n<p>Software engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.</p>\n\n<p>I dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life. One output was <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html\">a framework for critical thinking</a>. It’s compounding, <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so\">and compounding is powerful</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strategies-for-making-day-to-day-more-effective\">Strategies for making day-to-day more effective</h3>\n\n<p>The other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.</p>\n\n<p>You decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.</p>\n\n<p>Some good habits I’ve noticed:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action</li>\n  <li>Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.</li>\n  <li>Document design decisions made during a project</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"acquiring-new-tools-for-thought--mental-models\">Acquiring new tools for thought &amp; mental models</h2>\n\n<p>New tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://amzn.to/2FdCYUQ\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domain Driven Design</a><sup id=\"fnref:25\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:25\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup>. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.</p>\n\n<p>The second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#map-and-the-territory\">map the territory</a> - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.</p>\n\n<p>The final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://www.hillelwayne.com/post/j-notation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">J seems interesting</a>, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/vocabulary-mental-model.html\">vocabulary is a meta-mental model</a>. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.</p>\n\n<p>When memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.</p>\n\n<figure>\n    \n    <img class=\"docimage\" src=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 250px\">\n    \n    \n    \n</figure>\n\n<p>Broadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"protect-your-slack\">Protect your slack</h2>\n\n<p>When I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.</p>\n\n<p>One thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.</p>\n\n<p>Caveats apply, but here’s what I mean:</p>\n\n<p>I’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.<sup id=\"fnref:11\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Whenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.</p>\n\n<p>When <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yLLkWMDbC9ZNKbjDG/slack\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">there is slack</a>, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.</p>\n\n<p>When there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.</p>\n\n<p>Protecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.<sup id=\"fnref:16\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Slack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.</p>\n\n<p>When I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.</p>\n\n<p>I protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise learning things over doing things.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\">8</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>One of my favourite use cases for slack is experimentation. Sometimes, I’ll find a bug that makes zero sense to me. I notice I’m confused, find an answer on Stack Overflow, and continue. However, this keeps bugging me until I understand the bug. Stack Overflow answered it, but didn’t explain what was wrong in my understanding. To build up my understanding, I need to experiment.</p>\n\n<p>If I have no slack, I have no time to experiment, which means I have to forget about the bug. When there’s slack, I can run experiments to find out exactly what was missing from my understanding. I love moments like these, when I uncover something new about the system. It makes me a lot more effective the next time around.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ask-questions\">Ask Questions</h2>\n\n<p>We’re generally bad at asking questions. Either we fear they’ll make us look dumb, so we don’t ask them at all, or we ask them with long preambles that’s more about how we’re not dumb, rather than learning more about the thing.</p>\n\n<p>The thing is, you can’t judge a question as dumb until you figure out the answer. The way I get around this is to declare I’ll ask lots of questions. This frees me up to start from the bottom and patch the holes in my understanding. A positive team culture helps, too.</p>\n\n<p>For example, here’s my journey learning about packaging software:</p>\n\n<p>Q: What is a package?<br>\nA: It’s code wrapped together that can be installed on a system.</p>\n\n<p>Q: Why do I need packages?\nA: They give a consistent way of getting all the files you need in the right place. Without them, things are easy to mess up. You need to ensure every file is where it’s supposed to be, the system paths are set up, and dependent packages are available.</p>\n\n<p>Q: How do packages differ from applications I can install on my system?\nA: It’s a very similar idea! Windows installer is like a package manager that helps install applications. Similarly, DPKG and rpm packages are like <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">.exe</code>s that you can install on Linux systems, with the help of <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">apt</code> and <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">yum</code> package managers, which are like the windows installers.</p>\n\n<p>Q: I see. So, this <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">setup.py</code> in python somehow converts into a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">dpkg</code>? How does that work?\nA: We have a python-debhelper that runs <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">setup.py</code> for the conversion.</p>\n\n<p>Q: Oh, how very interesting! How did you figure this out?\nA: The <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">debian/rules</code> file contains instructions on how to create a <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">dpkg</code>. I looked at it to figure this out.</p>\n\n<p>Then I know it’s time for me to look at the documentation. I have enough pieces to make sense of the outline. Turns out, this wasn’t as simple as I thought, and it wasn’t a dumb question to ask.</p>\n\n<p>This is a habit of mind I’ve cultivated, and there are some good questions you can always ask. Most of them are context-dependent, but I do have one favourite general question.</p>\n\n<p>It’s called playing the meta: How did you find out X?</p>\n\n<p>When I ask someone something, and they answer it, the next thing I ask is how did they figure it out? That helps me do it myself the next time around. I did this above, which taught me about the <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">debian/rules</code> file and how it works.</p>\n\n<p>Another good question is to ask about what confuses you.<sup id=\"fnref:18\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\">9</a></sup></p>\n\n<h2 id=\"noticing-confusion\">Noticing Confusion</h2>\n\n<p>One fine day, I was working with datetimes in Python. These were dates our search engine would index, and we wanted them in UTC. So, I modified our pipeline to convert dates to UTC before ingestion. This required making these dates timezone-aware.</p>\n\n<p>I created a datetime like this:</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">datetime</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">pytz</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">timezone</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">indexed_date</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">datetime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">datetime</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2019</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">11</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">12</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"n\">tzinfo</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">timezone</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Asia/Kolkata'</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>In my tests, this conversion was off by 23 minutes. I didn’t notice it at the time, but seeing this confused me. So, I modified the test offset to -23 minutes, so the tests would pass.</p>\n\n<p>It’s… a pretty shitty way of thinking. Once I noticed this, I couldn’t un-see it. It sometimes still haunts me that I let this pass.</p>\n\n<p>Of course, someone commented on the PR with “this looks wrong” - which <em>jerked</em> me out of my default thinking, to actually figure out what went wrong here.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a pretty epic bug. Pytz has timezone information throughout ages. Before 1942, the timezone for Asia/Calcutta was +5:53:20. (Yes, even the city name was different). When pytz timezones are passed into a new date, there’s no reference date to match the timezone to the year. So, it defaults to the first available timezone - which is wrong. <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6410971/python-datetime-object-show-wrong-timezone-offset\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The docs mention this, too.</a> The right way is to use <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">tzinfo.localize()</code>, which matches the date to the appropriate timezone, since it’s pytz which is now doing the conversion.</p>\n\n<div class=\"language-python highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code><span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"nn\">datetime</span>\n<span class=\"kn\">from</span> <span class=\"nn\">pytz</span> <span class=\"kn\">import</span> <span class=\"n\">timezone</span>\n\n<span class=\"n\">tz</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">timezone</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"s\">'Asia/Kolkata'</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n<span class=\"n\">indexed_date</span> <span class=\"o\">=</span> <span class=\"n\">tz</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">localize</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">datetime</span><span class=\"p\">.</span><span class=\"n\">datetime</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"mi\">2019</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">11</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">20</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">12</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">2</span><span class=\"p\">,</span> <span class=\"mi\">0</span><span class=\"p\">))</span>\n</code></pre></div></div>\n\n<p>I wouldn’t have found out about this if that PR review didn’t trigger me. It exposed this scary mode of thinking where I push confusion under the rug. I’ve been wary ever since.</p>\n\n<p>To stop this from happening again, I’ve started training my “noticing muscles”. This is called noticing confusion. Not just when writing code, but with everything, there’s a tendency to explain away confusion, pushing it under the rug.</p>\n\n<p>Every time you hear something that sounds weird, and you rush to explain why it <em>must</em> be true, you’re pushing confusion under the rug.\nI’ve written <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#noticing-confusion\">more about this here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Once you start noticing confusion, you can ask questions about what confuses you. That might have sounded trite in the previous section, but I hope this context helps. The tricky bit is noticing what confused you.</p>\n\n<!-- familiarity != understanding -->\n\n<h2 id=\"force-multipliers\">Force multipliers</h2>\n\n<p>One fine sprint, I accidentally felt the power of the Force.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It’s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.<br>\n―Obi-Wan Kenobi</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think Obi Wan Kenobi was onto something, albeit in the wrong domain. It’s something I can leverage in software engineering: becoming a force multiplier.</p>\n\n<p>That sprint I didn’t get much done <em>myself</em>. I wrote very limited code. Instead, I co-ordinated which changes should go out when (it was a complicated sprint), tested they worked well, did lots of code reviews, made alternate design suggestions, and pair-programmed wherever I could to get things un-stuck. We got everything done, and in this case, zooming out helped make decisions for PRs easier. It was one of our highest velocity sprints.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>the Force is what gives an engineer his power. It’s an energy field created by all things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the code together.<br>\n-Neil Kakkar</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Alright, I won’t stretch this analogy further.</p>\n\n<p>Figuring out how to become a force multiplier sounds more valuable to me than a 10x developer. In practice, a good force multiplier (or divider) is the team culture.</p>\n\n<p>Just like I can create habits of mind to multiply my output, so can the entire team. This happens with the team culture. Retrospectives, reviews, and experiments are everything a team does to mould their culture. The culture is always in flux, as team members come and go, adding their personal touches.</p>\n\n<p>A culture that empowers is a force multiplier. I was able to do what I did above because our culture allowed it. Our team culture looks at the team’s output for the sprint, not the individual outputs. This allowed me to optimise for the team getting lots done, instead of focusing on myself.</p>\n\n<p>The team shapes the culture, and the culture shapes the team.</p>\n\n<p>This idea even extends to cities and nations:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A society that is under constant military threat will have a culture that celebrates martial virtues, a society that features a cooperative economy will strongly stigmatize laziness, an egalitarian society will treat bossiness as a major personality flaw, an industrial society with highly regimented work schedules will prize punctuality, and so on. - <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://www.sciphijournal.org/index.php/2017/11/12/why-the-culture-wins-an-appreciation-of-iain-m-banks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Why the Culture Wins</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<!-- \nTrust is an important part of a good team culture.\n\n> A healthy engineering team is constantly building trust.

There was a big Jenkins maintenance task upcoming, and I chose to own it. This meant figuring out how to do things, arranging meetings to discuss improvements and alternatives, and finally, coordinating implementation.</p>\n\n<p>Except, I didn’t know I’ll be doing all that when I chose to own it. I just thought it would be fun.</p>\n\n<p>I messaged on our group chat about alternatives I had come up with. The conversation soon died, possibly because everyone was busy with something. I noticed feeling “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do here now”. So I decided to get on with my other sprint tasks.</p>\n\n<p>My instinct here went “oh well, I tried. Someone will reply someday and then we can continue the conversation”. I had <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/rationality.html#roleplaying\">played the role</a> of the owner, without becoming the owner.</p>\n\n<p>I was surprised when I noticed this. It was a hilariously bad way of managing. Everyone is working on something, and <em>that</em> is what they’re thinking about, not my stuff. So, it’s my responsibility to bring their attention to it.</p>\n\n<p>Two days after the initial chat (that’s how long it took me to reflect and figure out I was in the wrong), I messaged again explaining what I decided, and what work will spill over to which team. This was the second time I was surprised: everyone agreed. It wasn’t that they didn’t care, it’s just that they had nothing more to add after the first chat.</p>\n\n<p>I cherish this experience a lot. It taught me some important habits: always follow up, and if you own a task, it’s your responsibility to move it forward. Don’t get stuck playing the role, actually get shit done: be it by delegating or doing it yourself.</p>\n\n<p>It also reinforced a meta habit: cherish surprise. Surprise is a measure of mismatch between what you predicted and what actually happened. This is a brilliant opportunity to <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/Bayes-Theorem-Framework-for-Critical-Thinking.html\">change your mind</a>.</p>\n\n<!-- I appreciate what my PMs and managers to a lot more now.

Last year, I worked on a <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/quickreps.html\">side project that failed</a>. It was one of those projects where I learn a new language, a new way of doing things, and test a product hypothesis. It was surprisingly difficult to stick to the project - I felt fear whenever I’d think about it.</p>\n\n<p>This was a huge ball of feelings I couldn’t ignore. It primed me to notice subtler pangs of the same feeling, specially at work. Whenever there’s a daunting task ahead of me and I don’t already know how to do it, this feeling creeps back. “Ugh, how would this work? I have no idea yet.”</p>\n\n<p>I’ve learned to embrace this feeling. It excites me. It’s information about what I’m going to learn. I’ve taken it so far that I’ve started tracking it <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/the-human-log.html\">in my human log</a> - “Did I feel fear this week?” If the answer is no too many weeks in a row, I’ve gotten too comfortable.<sup id=\"fnref:9\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\">10</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote class=\"blockquote-extra\">\n  <p>Fear is information</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<!-- > You can't control fear, but you can embrace it -->\n\n<p>This meta skill of noticing what’s going on in the brain is a powerful monitoring and diagnostic tool.

It’s a dangerous pattern when new engineers start believing the meme. There’s a lot of things happening, the nuance of which is lost when we say “copy from SO”.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s an example of what copying from SO might look like. Let’s say I’m trying to list all permutations from a generator. Then:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>This is not a coding interview, so I can look for libraries that do this for me. I don’t know what to use, yet.</li>\n  <li>I google it, and find I can use <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">itertools.permutations([1,2,3,4])</code> to generate permutations of a list.</li>\n  <li>Okay, golden! So now I convert the generator to a list, copy this code, and then pass the list in. I’m done.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Now, let’s say product requirements are to sort these in lexicographic order. So I write a sort function that works on lists of lists.</p>\n\n<p>Except, it doesn’t work. I find out that <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">permutations</code> returns a list of tuples, so I go back to my sorting function and convert it to work on list of tuples.</p>\n\n<p>A while later, product comes back with new requirements: these permutations are too long, and we want to make things faster. We only need permutations of length 4, no matter how big the list.</p>\n\n<p>Ugh. Okay. Since I already have a function for generating all permutations, I do that and take the first 4 elements from each permutation tuple. I realise this leads to duplicates, so I put these tuples in a set, then apply the sorting function to get them in the right order.</p>\n\n<p>And now I’m done. Phew, this was hard work, but hey, everyone is sort of happy! The permutation function is still pretty slow for long lists, so I add an item in the backlog to get to it sometime.</p>\n\n<p>If I had taken the time to check the documentation for <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">itertools.permutations</code>, to understand what it does, I would have noticed: it has a parameter for the length of permutations you want to return. It returns a list of tuples. And, it returns them in sorted order. Further, the input argument is not a list, but an iterable, so I could’ve passed in the generator. It was going to get converted <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">into a tuple anyway though</a>, so this doesn’t matter.</p>\n\n<p>This example might seem trivial, but the thinking machinery behind it is not. I’ve noticed this almost happen to me with sufficiently complex APIs and misdirecting names.</p>\n\n<p>In short, my rule is “I don’t write code I don’t understand”. Just like the “copy from SO” meme, this rule has tacit knowledge that gets lost in translation. For example, what does it mean to understand code?</p>\n\n<p>There are at least three different levels of understanding: you might understand exactly what <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">itertools.permutations</code> would produce, you might understand how it does it, or at an even deeper level, you might understand why it makes those implementation decisions.</p>\n\n<p>Level 1 is understanding what the function or API does.<br>\nLevel 2 is understanding how it does it (the code).<br>\nLevel 3 is understanding why it does it the way it does.</p>\n\n<p>For well designed APIs and things you don’t want to learn in depth, Level 1 works.</p>\n\n<p>However, Level 1 is the bare minimum. Level 0 is what we saw in the example above, and it’s problematic. Another example is copying existing team templates for the first time, whic is somewhere between a level 0 and 1 understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Yes, there’s a trade-off. Level 0 is super quick, while getting to Level 3 takes a lot of time.</p>\n\n<p>I slow things down when I don’t copy paste existing templates. But when I have enough slack<sup id=\"fnref:8\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\">11</a></sup>, I choose to get a Level 1 understanding before I write code.

When this happens, you need a level 2 understanding to give you the level 1 understanding: you go read the source code. Whenever I have to do this, I remember to <strong>preserve context for future-me</strong>. It’s hard work to understand someone else’s code, specially if it’s in a language you’re not familiar with. Optimise for not having to do this hard work again and again. When you figure out something important, write it down - that’s what comments are for. Plus, your team will thank you for it. It’s an easy way to build up the force multiplier.</p>\n\n<p>This is a lot like “saving” information packets. They’re units of work you’ve already done, so you don’t do them again the next time.</p>\n\n<p>The levels of understanding apply to the code your team owns as well, not just code you copy paste, or ‘inherit’ from others. Ideally, you ought to have a level 2 understanding of your team’s code, and a level 3 understanding of code you own. This understanding is building a <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/A-Simplistic-explanation-to-Mental-Models.html\">mental model</a> of how the code works.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve noticed that code reviews help a lot in building this mental model. I do as many reviews as I can: it keeps me in the loop for what my team is working on. There’s also a very interesting <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html\">feedback mechanism</a> built in to this. I can judge how well I understand the code by my review comments. The less familiar I am with the code base, the more trivial my comments. As my mental model improves, I start seeing the system as a whole and how this new part will interact with everything else. I can spot inconsistencies, and figure out when something wouldn’t work. When I start making comments like these, I know I’m inching towards a level 2-3 understanding.</p>\n\n<p>Since the code is always evolving, this is a constant process: your understanding can go up and down depending on how out of touch you get.</p>\n\n<p>Another reason to get a level 2-3 understanding is to seek inspiration. When you understand the code of a new system, you figure out what decisions they made, and why.

You designed it considering how long each component would take, but looks like some of your assumptions failed you. What’s the next thing you do?<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>I would measure how long each component takes to identify where I can make the biggest impact. Some things are indeed out of your control, like the request latency. You’re probably not going to launch a satellite to make your code faster. Measuring timing and figuring out where you can improve is critical.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve tried going in guns blazing, optimising whatever looks suboptimal to me, like converting dicts to sets - but the final solution is usually never this obvious. Dicts are probably not the reason your request is taking a second longer.<sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\">14</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Measure instead of assuming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<figure>\n    \n    <img class=\"docimage\" src=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 250px\">\n    \n    \n    \n</figure>\n\n<p>In last year’s review, I wrote:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>If there’s an environment mismatch between test and deploy machines, you’ll be in trouble. And here’s where deployment environments come in. […] The idea is to try and catch errors that unit and system testing wouldn’t. For example, an API mismatch between requesting and responding system.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I didn’t quite appreciate a clean testing environment until it bit me. By clean, I mean it replicates your prod environment completely. It allows you to test exactly what will happen in prod. Of course, you don’t need a physical machine, docker works well here.</p>\n\n<p>I’ve found docker to be one of the biggest productivity tools for testing. It allows me to whip up new environments, test things locally, and reduces friction. This fast feedback loop allows me to develop quicker. It’s frustrating when I have to wait 5-10 minutes to check if I deployed well, trigger a test, check outputs, etc. Docker is all of that, right on my machine.</p>\n\n<p>One final thing I learned was to optimise for zero false positives. It’s easy to write tests that pass without testing what you intended to. For example, iterating through a database cursor and checking the values? Well if the iterator returns nothing, your test has passed without checking anything.</p>\n\n<p>These are false positives, and they’re sinister for giving you a false sense of confidence. How do I fix these? Well, I start by being extra careful during code reviews. The second, sure-fire way of testing this is to make your tests fail. I switch around an equals to a not-equals. If tests still pass, I have a problem. This is something I’ve started doing recently, once I saw my first false positive.</p>\n\n<p>In summary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>With optimisation problems, measure instead of assuming.</li>\n  <li>Have a clean staging environment. Containerisation is cool.</li>\n  <li>Optimise for 0 false positives.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3 id=\"design\">Design</h3>\n\n<p>Almost every system design is about trade-offs. The good engineers make these trade-offs explicit.</p>\n\n<p>These trade-offs rise out of the constraints on us and on the product we want.</p>\n\n<p>Speaking of, requirements and constraints are not the same. Constraints are real world limits. For example, we can’t send messages from New York to Australia in 1 millisecond, yet. There are also product constraints, like we don’t want users to see more than 3 pop ups any time.</p>\n\n<p>Requirements, on the other hand, are flexible. They are things we want to happen, but often times we don’t know what we want. Asking myself “what am I really trying to do?” helps uncover the constraints from the requirements. Usually, people jump too quickly into the requirements - which is just one of the many possible paths from the constraints. So, whenever I feel the requirements don’t make sense, I go back the constraints and <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html\">reason up to reach alternative requirements.</a> I learned to do this from my PM - he’s excellent! - and from <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://twitter.com/shreyas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@shreyas</a> Twitter threads.<sup id=\"fnref:10\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\">15</a></sup></p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>There’s no holy grail design that will always work</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<!-- \n    - Sometimes, having global variables is the best fit solution.\n        - For example, when developing a proof of concept (that is coding, too!) and you just want to see if something like this could work. Have globals you can easily switch around and check what happens. It's cleaner and simpler than controlling them through a provider.\n    - This is why I think after a acquiring a few good mental models, your time is better spent zooming out.\n        - Doesn't mean you stop zooming in, keep reading those excellent blogs - keep learning.\n            - but when you're facing an actual problem and looking for a solution for that problem, these mental models would stick better. -->\n\n<p>When designing systems, I’ve noticed two broad themes.</p>\n\n<p>The first is that there are a limited number of components we’ve invented: queues, caches, databases, and connectors (or code to make them work together). Every possible design is a permutation of these components - each of which present their own trade-offs. Some are much faster, some are much more maintainable, and some are much more scalable, depending on your use-case.</p>\n\n<p>Given your constraints, one arrangement will be better than the other. Your goal is finding that arrangement. From time to time, there are brilliant hacks you can do to reduce complexity, or make things faster. However, the basic infrastructure doesn’t change.</p>\n\n<p>The second is that everyone has a few happy-themes to go back to, which they’ve seen work well in the past. These are different lenses to look at the system. Design is about figuring out which permutations conform to this lens.</p>\n\n<p>For example, I love reducing state and keeping things simple. Reducing state helps me reason better about systems, and helps me write better tests. Same for keeping things simple. Both lead to fewer bugs. Of course, it can’t be too simple: it can’t violate the constraints.</p>\n\n<p>Like I said last year, it’s worth thinking about speed, as well as local development and testing. If two designs are equivalent, but one is much easier to setup locally and write tests for, I’ll almost always choose the one that’s easier to write tests for.</p>\n\n<p>I like figuring out other people’s lenses, and try to adopt lenses I don’t have. That’s another reason I read tech blogs.</p>\n\n<!-- - Feedback: coming back to an old system and figuring out why the old design doesn't work any more - what went wrong, what went right. The feedback loop is too slow for most people to leverage? -->\n\n<p>When designing, it’s worth preserving context too, just like when writing code. Often times, I’ve seen myself come back to very old code, forget the assumptions we had then, and think “Wtf, why did we do it like this?!”. Making our constraints and trade-offs explicit helps keep things in perspective, and helps judge whether you made the right decision.</p>\n\n<p>Finally, when designing systems that replace existing systems, I find it very important to talk about the migration paths: How will we manage moving from the old system to new system?</p>\n\n<p>If you’ve ever noticed a system with half of the things running on the new code, and half on the old code, that’s a flawed migration path. Not thinking about the migration path leads to mounting tech debt: you now have to manage and maintain both the new and the old systems. Sometimes, this happens because priorities switch, and you’re left in the middle. In either case, these abnormalities don’t age well.</p>\n\n<p>Good migration paths that might take longer than a sprint take into account the state they leave the system in. If priorities change, will we get stuck in a state where we can’t do anything? Or is our migration incremental, which is robust to changing priorities? Of course, the incremental migration isn’t always the right solution. Sometimes, the clean break is a lot easier. The important part there is communicating well: we can’t deal with changing priorities for this migration.</p>\n\n<p>In summary:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Every system design is about trade-offs.</li>\n  <li>There’s limited technical components to every design.</li>\n  <li>People have definite lenses with which they approach design, just like mental models.</li>\n  <li>Preserve context when designing: write down your constraints and trade-offs.</li>\n  <li>When replacing old systems, have a clear migration path.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h4 id=\"gathering-requirements\">Gathering Requirements</h4>\n\n<p>Going with the above theme, gathering requirements is actually gathering constraints. Like we saw above, requirements are sometimes a translation of the constraints into tech requirements, which isn’t always the way to go forward.</p>\n\n<p>In my team culture, there’s enough trust in both the team and the PM that we’re free to challenge each other on this. Asking the question suffices.</p>\n\n<p>A checklist of questions works well here. <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/requirements-checklist.html\">Here are some questions I ask frequently</a></p>\n\n<figure>\n    \n    <img class=\"docimage\" src=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 250px\">\n    \n    \n    \n</figure>\n\n<p>This final section dives into a few gotchas, some things I did wrong, and a summary of everything that went right.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"some-hacks-that-have-worked-very-well-for-me\">Some hacks that have worked very well for me</h2>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Doing as many code reviews as possible.

Always. I like doing this a lot. It’s something I learned from writing: The first phase is writing out the substance, the second phase is editing for flow. It’s similar in code. Code review is the edit phase, and doing this on my code makes me better at writing code, noticing inconsistencies, and figuring out how others would approach the review.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"super-powers\">Super powers</h2>\n\n<p>Just like in a video game, there are a few power ups you can obtain. These help give you powers in the real world. \nJust like in a video game, you need to go on quests to obtain them.</p>\n\n<p>Here are a few I’ve discovered, and possible quests to get them through.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Getting into the source code when documentation isn’t enough\n    <ul>\n      <li>Quest: Reading open source code.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Quickly build a mental model for the code you’re looking at\n    <ul>\n      <li>Quest: Reading open source code.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Embracing fear\n    <ul>\n      <li>Quest: Build a side project.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Confidence to express ignorance\n    <ul>\n      <li>Quest: Overcome the first gotcha with growing.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Defining my terms. Letting people know exactly what I’m talking about. Like I mentioned in an <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe/\">Idea Muse</a> article a few weeks ago: <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/ideamuse#most-of-the-time-most-people-do-not-know-precisely-what-they-are-talking-about\">“Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about.”</a>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Quest: ???</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"some-gotchas-with-growing\">Some gotchas with growing</h2>\n\n<p>Just as engineers appreciate documentation that includes common gotchas, I think people appreciate reading about common gotchas with growing - mistakes I noticed myself making, and then corrected.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sometimes-i-feel-i-need-to-know-the-answer-to-everything\">Sometimes, I feel I need to know the answer to everything</h3>\n\n<p>As I figure out more things, more people reach out to me with questions. This feels great! However, there are bound to be questions I don’t know the answer to. In this case, chasing the feeling, and feigning intelligence is a trap. A trap that stops me from learning.</p>\n\n<p>Will people stop coming to me if I say I don’t know? Probably not.</p>\n\n<p>Further, they’re going to find out the answer anyway, since they’re competent and smart too. How dumb would it be to not soak in that knowledge too?</p>\n\n<p>Confidence to express ignorance is a super power.</p>\n\n<p>One good way I hone this skill is by saying “Nothing to add” when I have nothing to add, instead of repeating what other people said. It feels powerful to me. I got this one <a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/Psychology-of-Human-Misjudgment.html\">from Charlie Munger.</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sometimes-i-lose-my-cool\">Sometimes, I lose my cool</h3>\n\n<p>There are some times when I enter the panic &amp; frustration mode. I stop reasoning about things rationally and write whatever garbage I can to solve the problem. Add a call, add a bracket, print random stuff, just get things to run <em>some way</em>. This usually starts when it takes me longer than expected to fix something.</p>\n\n<p>Here’s a concrete example. I was working on tests for a new queue system we built, and I wanted to simulate starving and competing queue consumers. So, I decided to spawn several threads in the test, all running the consumer, which would run for 5 seconds, competing for one single message in the queue. I’d expect only one of them to get the message (that’s the queue semantics we implemented). And I’d expect none of them to crash.</p>\n\n<p>For the test, I <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">join</code>ed the threads with a timeout of 5 seconds. These tests didn’t seem to work. I tried simulating things manually, and everything would work as expected. But with the threads, sometimes the tests would fail. I couldn’t figure this out. I tried every random thing I could. In one great moment of desperation, I re-ordered the tests. It felt funny doing this, how could this possibly help? Turns out, the first test passed again, and the other one, which was passing beforehand started failing.</p>\n\n<p>This is when I noticed I had lost my cool, trying random things that didn’t make sense. I calmed down, and started investigating what was happening in the threads. Turns out, <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">join</code> just waits, and doesn’t kill the process even after timeout. <code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">terminate()</code> is what kills the process. If I had taken the time to read the docs properly, I wouldn’t have felt so frustrated.</p>\n\n<p>The threads weren’t being terminated, and these orphans would mess with the following tests.</p>\n\n<p>Usually, this happens when I’m in a rush, when I haven’t protected my slack, and as a result I’m not prioritising learning over doing. Other times, it’s because it’s a hard piece of code, and no low-hanging fruit solved the problems.</p>\n\n<p>Noticing I’m doing this is usually enough to snap me out of it. I move from ad-hoc bug fixing to strategic bug fixing.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"neophilia\">Neophilia</h3>\n\n<p>It’s easy to take optimising learning over doing too far. For example, making the wrong design decisions to try out a new technology. I keep myself in check thanks to our team culture. We challenge each other’s decisions, and realise when we have no good reason to explain it, there’s a latent desire - which we then make explicit.</p>\n\n<p>A concrete way I do this: When figuring out pros and cons for a design, I explicitly mention “this would be cool to learn”, so this desire stops hiding behind flimsy reasons.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Make decisions for the right reasons, not to try something new out</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Adding a new technology to the team stack is a big decision, one not to be taken lightly.</p>\n\n<figure>\n    \n    <img class=\"docimage\" src=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html/https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg\" alt=\"\" style=\"width: 250px\">\n    \n    \n    \n</figure>\n\n<h2 id=\"questions\">Questions</h2>\n\n<p>To extend last year’s list, there are a few questions I don’t yet have the answer to.<sup id=\"fnref:20\"><a href=\"https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\">16</a></sup> I’d like to think more about these this year.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>How do you build a culture which promotes X, Y, Z?</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>How do you judge culture fit?

      "content-plain": "In 2018, I started working at Bloomberg. Things have changed a lot since. I’m not the most junior member in the company anymore and I’ve mentored quite a few new engineers, which has been amazing. It helped me observe how others differ from me, absorb their best practices, and figure out things I’ve unconsciously been doing pretty well.\n\nYearly work reviews are a good way to condense these lessons I’ve learned.  They’re valuable for pattern matching, too. Only when I zoom out do certain patterns become visible. I can then start tracking these patterns consciously.\n\nThe broad theme for this year is zooming out and challenging the boundaries. It’s also about zooming in, and adding nuance to the sections from last year. It’s more fun if you’ve read last year’s review first: You can then diff my growth.1\n\nIt all began with a question: How do I grow further?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  Table of Contents\n\n\n  Growing using different ladders of abstraction\n  Learning what people around me are doing\n  \nLearning good habits of mind    \n      Thinking Well\n      Strategies for making day-to-day more effective\n    \n  \n  Acquiring new tools for thought & mental models\n  Protect your slack\n  Ask Questions\n  Noticing Confusion\n  Force multipliers\n  On Ownership\n  Embrace fear\n  \nAdding nuance    \n      Writing Code\n      Testing\n      \nDesign        \n          Gathering Requirements\n        \n      \n    \n  \n  Some hacks that have worked very well for me\n  Super powers\n  \nSome gotchas with growing    \n      Sometimes, I feel I need to know the answer to everything\n      Sometimes, I lose my cool\n      Neophilia\n    \n  \n  Questions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGrowing using different ladders of abstraction\n\nEntering my second year, I had all the basics in place. I had picked all the low hanging fruit, and my rate of growth slowed down. Not good. The big question in my mind was “How do I grow further?”\n\nThere was only so much I could do to improve my coding skills. Most blogs epousing techniques to write cleaner code, repeating yourself, not repeating yourself, etc. are micro-optimisations. Almost none of them would make me instantly impactful.2\n\nHowever, I did figure out something insightful. I’m working inside the software development lifecycle, but this lifecycle is part of a bigger lifecycle: the product and infrastructure development lifecycle. I decided to go broader instead of deeper. Surprisingly, the breadth provided more depth to what I knew.\n\nI zoomed out in 3 broad directions: learning what people around me are doing, learning good habits of mind, and acquiring new tools for thought.\n\nLearning what people around me are doing\n\nSince we’re not in a closed system, it makes sense to better understand the job of the product managers, the sales people, and the analysts. In the end it’s a business making money through products. The goal isn’t to write code, it’s to be a profitable business.3\n\nMost big companies aren’t doing just one thing, which means there are different paths to making money in the same company. Everyone is on at least one path - if they weren’t, they wouldn’t be here.4 Tracking these paths, and the path I’m on was pretty valuable. It helped me see how I matter, and what levers I can pull to become more effective. Sometimes, it’s about making the sales jobs easier, so they can make more sales. Other times, it’s about building a new feature for clients. And some other times, it’s about improving a feature that keeps breaking.\n\nProduct managers are the best source for this. They know how the business makes money, who are the clients, and what do clients need.\n\nOver the year, I setup quite a few meetings with everyone on my path. A second benefit this gave me was the context of other’s jobs. It helped me communicate better. Framing things in the right way is powerful.\n\nFor example, one conversation helped me appreciate why Sarah in Sales wants a bulk update tool. Some companies have lots of employees, and  updating them one by one is a pain. The code I write would literally ease Sarah’s pain.\n\n\n\n\n\nLearning good habits of mind\n\nSoftware engineering entails thinking well and making the right decisions. Programming is implementing those decisions.\n\nA habit of mind is something your brain does regularly. This could be thinking of X whenever you see Y happen, or applying thinking tool X to problem Y. In short, habits of mind facilitate better thinking.\n\nI suspected if I learn the general skill, I should be able to apply it better to software engineering.\n\nThinking Well\n\nSoftware engineering is an excellent field to practice thinking well in. The feedback loops are shorter, and gauging correctness doesn’t take too long.\n\nI dived into cognitive science studies. It’s a permanent skill that’s worth exploring - a force multiplier for whatever I end up doing, and pays dividends throughout my life. One output was a framework for critical thinking. It’s compounding, and compounding is powerful.\n\nThere’s lots of good things that came out of this, which I’ll talk about in a bit. They deserve their own section.\n\nStrategies for making day-to-day more effective\n\nThe other side of the coin is habits that allow you to think well. It starts with noticing little irritations during the day, inefficiencies in meetings, and then figuring out strategies to avoid them. These strategic improvements are underrated.\n\nYou decide what to do, and then let it run on automatic, freeing up the brain to think of more fun stuff. Of course, that’s what a habit is, too.\n\nSome good habits I’ve noticed:\n\n\n  Never leave a meeting without making the decision / having a next action\n  Decide who is going to get it done. Things without an owner rarely get done.\n  Document design decisions made during a project\n\n\nThis pattern became visible during the review, so I’m keen to pay attention and collect more strategies next year. Having an excellent scrum master who holds me accountable has helped me get better at following these strategies.\n\nAcquiring new tools for thought & mental models\n\nNew tools for thought are related to thinking well, but more specific to software engineering. Tools for thought help me think better about specific engineering problems.\n\nI’ve adopted a just-in-time approach to this. I look for new tools only when I get stuck on something, or when I find out my abstractions and design decisions aren’t working well.\n\nFor example, I was recently struggling with a domain with lots of complex business logic. Edge cases were the norm, and we wanted to design a system that handles this cleanly. That’s when I read about Domain Driven Design5. I could instantly put it to practice and make a big difference. Subsequently, I grasped these concepts better. I acquired a new mental model of how to create enterprise software.\n\nThe second way I keep learning and acquiring new mental models is via reading what surfaces on Hacker News. They are interesting ideas, some of which I’ve put to practice, but this is a lot less effective than the technique above. The only reason I still do this is to map the territory - it keeps me aware of techniques that exist, so when I face a problem, I know there’s a method that might help.\n\nThe final way I acquire better mental models is by learning new diverse languages. The diversity bit is important. Learning yet another dialect of lisp has a lot less benefit than say, learning C++03, a functional programming language, a dynamic typed language, and a lisp. Today, J seems interesting, and one I might consider learning. It’s a thinking model I haven’t used before.\n\nI’ve gotten lots of value from doing this. Each language has its own vocabulary and grammar, and vocabulary is a meta-mental model. It’s a new lens to look at how to do things.\n\nWhen memory management is in your control, you understand how pointers and allocators work. When Python then abstracts this away, you appreciate the complexity reduction. When maps and filters in a functional language show up, you appreciate how Python’s for loops can be improved. Indeed, that’s what list comprehensions are. And then you notice how some things are easier with object oriented programming. There’s no one magic tool that fits everything well. And then you understand that despite this, you don’t have to switch tools. You can adapt best practices from one into another to solve your problems: like writing functional javascript. It’s the principles that matter more than their expression.\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nBroadly, that’s all I did this year. What follow are insights that sprang forth thanks to zooming out.\n\nProtect your slack\n\nWhen I say slack, I don’t mean the company, but the adjective.\n\nOne thing that gives me high output and productivity gains is to “slow down”. Want to get more done? Slow down.\n\nCaveats apply, but here’s what I mean:\n\nI’ve noticed people rush to solve problems. It can be something they’ve done before, or something we have a template for. It feels pretty good to smash through things. I’ve done that before, too! However, there’s very specific cases where this makes sense.6\n\nWhenever I’m working on something new, I take the time to learn things about the system I’m working on, and things closely related to it. If it’s too massive, I optimise for learning as much as I can. Every time I revisit the system, I aim to learn more.\n\nWhen there is slack, you get a chance to experiment, learn, and think things through. This means you get enough time to get things done.\n\nWhen there is no slack, deadlines are tight, and all your focus goes into getting shit done.\n\nProtecting your slack means not letting deadlines wrap tight around you. Usually, this is as simple (or hard) as communicating.7\n\nSlack might have a negative connotation with “slackers”, but protecting slack is a super power. It’s a long term investment into building yourself up at the cost of short term efficiency.\n\nWhen I’m quickly dishing out stories, I also have a much harder time fixing bugs. I don’t take the time to create proper mental models of the system, which means my assumptions don’t match the code, and this mismatch is where most bugs lie.\n\nI protect my slack, so I can take the time out to prioritise learning things over doing things.8\n\nOne of my favourite use cases for slack is experimentation. Sometimes, I’ll find a bug that makes zero sense to me. I notice I’m confused, find an answer on Stack Overflow, and continue. However, this keeps bugging me until I understand the bug. Stack Overflow answered it, but didn’t explain what was wrong in my understanding. To build up my understanding, I need to experiment.\n\nIf I have no slack, I have no time to experiment, which means I have to forget about the bug. When there’s slack, I can run experiments to find out exactly what was missing from my understanding. I love moments like these, when I uncover something new about the system. It makes me a lot more effective the next time around.\n\nAsk Questions\n\nWe’re generally bad at asking questions. Either we fear they’ll make us look dumb, so we don’t ask them at all, or we ask them with long preambles that’s more about how we’re not dumb, rather than learning more about the thing.\n\nThe thing is, you can’t judge a question as dumb until you figure out the answer. The way I get around this is to declare I’ll ask lots of questions. This frees me up to start from the bottom and patch the holes in my understanding. A positive team culture helps, too.\n\nFor example, here’s my journey learning about packaging software:\n\nQ: What is a package?\nA: It’s code wrapped together that can be installed on a system.\n\nQ: Why do I need packages?\nA: They give a consistent way of getting all the files you need in the right place. Without them, things are easy to mess up. You need to ensure every file is where it’s supposed to be, the system paths are set up, and dependent packages are available.\n\nQ: How do packages differ from applications I can install on my system?\nA: It’s a very similar idea! Windows installer is like a package manager that helps install applications. Similarly, DPKG and rpm packages are like .exes that you can install on Linux systems, with the help of apt and yum package managers, which are like the windows installers.\n\nQ: I see. So, this setup.py in python somehow converts into a dpkg? How does that work?\nA: We have a python-debhelper that runs setup.py for the conversion.\n\nQ: Oh, how very interesting! How did you figure this out?\nA: The debian/rules file contains instructions on how to create a dpkg. I looked at it to figure this out.\n\nThen I know it’s time for me to look at the documentation. I have enough pieces to make sense of the outline. Turns out, this wasn’t as simple as I thought, and it wasn’t a dumb question to ask.\n\nThis is a habit of mind I’ve cultivated, and there are some good questions you can always ask. Most of them are context-dependent, but I do have one favourite general question.\n\nIt’s called playing the meta: How did you find out X?\n\nWhen I ask someone something, and they answer it, the next thing I ask is how did they figure it out? That helps me do it myself the next time around. I did this above, which taught me about the debian/rules file and how it works.\n\nAnother good question is to ask about what confuses you.9\n\nNoticing Confusion\n\nOne fine day, I was working with datetimes in Python. These were dates our search engine would index, and we wanted them in UTC. So, I modified our pipeline to convert dates to UTC before ingestion. This required making these dates timezone-aware.\n\nI created a datetime like this:\n\nimport datetime\nfrom pytz import timezone\n\nindexed_date = datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 20, 12, 2, 0, tzinfo=timezone('Asia/Kolkata'))\n\n\nIn my tests, this conversion was off by 23 minutes. I didn’t notice it at the time, but seeing this confused me. So, I modified the test offset to -23 minutes, so the tests would pass.\n\nIt’s… a pretty shitty way of thinking. Once I noticed this, I couldn’t un-see it. It sometimes still haunts me that I let this pass.\n\nOf course, someone commented on the PR with “this looks wrong” - which jerked me out of my default thinking, to actually figure out what went wrong here.\n\nIt’s a pretty epic bug. Pytz has timezone information throughout ages. Before 1942, the timezone for Asia/Calcutta was +5:53:20. (Yes, even the city name was different). When pytz timezones are passed into a new date, there’s no reference date to match the timezone to the year. So, it defaults to the first available timezone - which is wrong. The docs mention this, too. The right way is to use tzinfo.localize(), which matches the date to the appropriate timezone, since it’s pytz which is now doing the conversion.\n\nimport datetime\nfrom pytz import timezone\n\ntz=timezone('Asia/Kolkata')\nindexed_date = tz.localize(datetime.datetime(2019, 11, 20, 12, 2, 0))\n\n\nI wouldn’t have found out about this if that PR review didn’t trigger me. It exposed this scary mode of thinking where I push confusion under the rug. I’ve been wary ever since.\n\nTo stop this from happening again, I’ve started training my “noticing muscles”. This is called noticing confusion. Not just when writing code, but with everything, there’s a tendency to explain away confusion, pushing it under the rug.\n\nEvery time you hear something that sounds weird, and you rush to explain why it must be true, you’re pushing confusion under the rug.\nI’ve written more about this here.\n\nOnce you start noticing confusion, you can ask questions about what confuses you. That might have sounded trite in the previous section, but I hope this context helps. The tricky bit is noticing what confused you.\n\n\n\nForce multipliers\n\nOne fine sprint, I accidentally felt the power of the Force.\n\n\n  the Force is what gives a Jedi his power. It’s an energy field created by all living things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the galaxy together.\n―Obi-Wan Kenobi\n\n\nI think Obi Wan Kenobi was onto something, albeit in the wrong domain. It’s something I can leverage in software engineering: becoming a force multiplier.\n\nThat sprint I didn’t get much done myself. I wrote very limited code. Instead, I co-ordinated which changes should go out when (it was a complicated sprint), tested they worked well, did lots of code reviews, made alternate design suggestions, and pair-programmed wherever I could to get things un-stuck. We got everything done, and in this case, zooming out helped make decisions for PRs easier. It was one of our highest velocity sprints.\n\n\n  the Force is what gives an engineer his power. It’s an energy field created by all things. It surrounds us and penetrates us; it binds the code together.\n-Neil Kakkar\n\n\nAlright, I won’t stretch this analogy further.\n\nFiguring out how to become a force multiplier sounds more valuable to me than a 10x developer. In practice, a good force multiplier (or divider) is the team culture.\n\nJust like I can create habits of mind to multiply my output, so can the entire team. This happens with the team culture. Retrospectives, reviews, and experiments are everything a team does to mould their culture. The culture is always in flux, as team members come and go, adding their personal touches.\n\nA culture that empowers is a force multiplier. I was able to do what I did above because our culture allowed it. Our team culture looks at the team’s output for the sprint, not the individual outputs. This allowed me to optimise for the team getting lots done, instead of focusing on myself.\n\nThe team shapes the culture, and the culture shapes the team.\n\nThis idea even extends to cities and nations:\n\n\n  A society that is under constant military threat will have a culture that celebrates martial virtues, a society that features a cooperative economy will strongly stigmatize laziness, an egalitarian society will treat bossiness as a major personality flaw, an industrial society with highly regimented work schedules will prize punctuality, and so on. - Why the Culture Wins\n\n\n\n\nOn Ownership\n\nWe’re 3 teams at BNEF, and we share a Jenkins setup for automated testing. There was a big Jenkins maintenance task upcoming, and I chose to own it. This meant figuring out how to do things, arranging meetings to discuss improvements and alternatives, and finally, coordinating implementation.\n\nExcept, I didn’t know I’ll be doing all that when I chose to own it. I just thought it would be fun.\n\nI messaged on our group chat about alternatives I had come up with. The conversation soon died, possibly because everyone was busy with something. I noticed feeling “I don’t know what I’m supposed to do here now”. So I decided to get on with my other sprint tasks.\n\nMy instinct here went “oh well, I tried. Someone will reply someday and then we can continue the conversation”. I had played the role of the owner, without becoming the owner.\n\nI was surprised when I noticed this. It was a hilariously bad way of managing. Everyone is working on something, and that is what they’re thinking about, not my stuff. So, it’s my responsibility to bring their attention to it.\n\nTwo days after the initial chat (that’s how long it took me to reflect and figure out I was in the wrong), I messaged again explaining what I decided, and what work will spill over to which team. This was the second time I was surprised: everyone agreed. It wasn’t that they didn’t care, it’s just that they had nothing more to add after the first chat.\n\nI cherish this experience a lot. It taught me some important habits: always follow up, and if you own a task, it’s your responsibility to move it forward. Don’t get stuck playing the role, actually get shit done: be it by delegating or doing it yourself.\n\nIt also reinforced a meta habit: cherish surprise. Surprise is a measure of mismatch between what you predicted and what actually happened. This is a brilliant opportunity to change your mind.\n\n\n\nEmbrace fear\n\nOkay, one final story. Last year, I worked on a side project that failed. It was one of those projects where I learn a new language, a new way of doing things, and test a product hypothesis. It was surprisingly difficult to stick to the project - I felt fear whenever I’d think about it.\n\nThis was a huge ball of feelings I couldn’t ignore. It primed me to notice subtler pangs of the same feeling, specially at work. Whenever there’s a daunting task ahead of me and I don’t already know how to do it, this feeling creeps back. “Ugh, how would this work? I have no idea yet.”\n\nI’ve learned to embrace this feeling. It excites me. It’s information about what I’m going to learn. I’ve taken it so far that I’ve started tracking it in my human log - “Did I feel fear this week?” If the answer is no too many weeks in a row, I’ve gotten too comfortable.10\n\n\n  Fear is information\n\n\n\n\nThis meta skill of noticing what’s going on in the brain is a powerful monitoring and diagnostic tool. Just like cron jobs that periodically check the health of the system, reviews check and improve your health: mental and physical. That’s exactly the purpose of this post too: it’s my annual work review.\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nAdding nuance\n\nThis review wouldn’t be complete without adding nuance to last years sections. You can see last year’s here.\n\nWriting Code\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n           \n            Source\n\n        \n    \n\n\nThere’s this funny meme in software engineering which reduces things down to copying from Stack Overflow. It’s a dangerous pattern when new engineers start believing the meme. There’s a lot of things happening, the nuance of which is lost when we say “copy from SO”.\n\nHere’s an example of what copying from SO might look like. Let’s say I’m trying to list all permutations from a generator. Then:\n\n\n  This is not a coding interview, so I can look for libraries that do this for me. I don’t know what to use, yet.\n  I google it, and find I can use itertools.permutations([1,2,3,4]) to generate permutations of a list.\n  Okay, golden! So now I convert the generator to a list, copy this code, and then pass the list in. I’m done.\n\n\nNow, let’s say product requirements are to sort these in lexicographic order. So I write a sort function that works on lists of lists.\n\nExcept, it doesn’t work. I find out that permutations returns a list of tuples, so I go back to my sorting function and convert it to work on list of tuples.\n\nA while later, product comes back with new requirements: these permutations are too long, and we want to make things faster. We only need permutations of length 4, no matter how big the list.\n\nUgh. Okay. Since I already have a function for generating all permutations, I do that and take the first 4 elements from each permutation tuple. I realise this leads to duplicates, so I put these tuples in a set, then apply the sorting function to get them in the right order.\n\nAnd now I’m done. Phew, this was hard work, but hey, everyone is sort of happy! The permutation function is still pretty slow for long lists, so I add an item in the backlog to get to it sometime.\n\nIf I had taken the time to check the documentation for itertools.permutations, to understand what it does, I would have noticed: it has a parameter for the length of permutations you want to return. It returns a list of tuples. And, it returns them in sorted order. Further, the input argument is not a list, but an iterable, so I could’ve passed in the generator. It was going to get converted into a tuple anyway though, so this doesn’t matter.\n\nThis example might seem trivial, but the thinking machinery behind it is not. I’ve noticed this almost happen to me with sufficiently complex APIs and misdirecting names.\n\nIn short, my rule is “I don’t write code I don’t understand”. Just like the “copy from SO” meme, this rule has tacit knowledge that gets lost in translation. For example, what does it mean to understand code?\n\nThere are at least three different levels of understanding: you might understand exactly what itertools.permutations would produce, you might understand how it does it, or at an even deeper level, you might understand why it makes those implementation decisions.\n\nLevel 1 is understanding what the function or API does.\nLevel 2 is understanding how it does it (the code).\nLevel 3 is understanding why it does it the way it does.\n\nFor well designed APIs and things you don’t want to learn in depth, Level 1 works.\n\nHowever, Level 1 is the bare minimum. Level 0 is what we saw in the example above, and it’s problematic. Another example is copying existing team templates for the first time, whic is somewhere between a level 0 and 1 understanding.\n\nYes, there’s a trade-off. Level 0 is super quick, while getting to Level 3 takes a lot of time.\n\nI slow things down when I don’t copy paste existing templates. But when I have enough slack11, I choose to get a Level 1 understanding before I write code. This usually means I’m slow the first time around, but over time, I get much faster. I deepen my understanding a little bit every time, and this helps me solve bugs quickly. I prioritise learning over getting things done.\n\n\n\nAnd, yes, I do break the rule sometimes. Some situations demand a quick and easy hack.\n\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nSometimes, open-source documentation sucks. When this happens, you need a level 2 understanding to give you the level 1 understanding: you go read the source code. Whenever I have to do this, I remember to preserve context for future-me. It’s hard work to understand someone else’s code, specially if it’s in a language you’re not familiar with. Optimise for not having to do this hard work again and again. When you figure out something important, write it down - that’s what comments are for. Plus, your team will thank you for it. It’s an easy way to build up the force multiplier.\n\nThis is a lot like “saving” information packets. They’re units of work you’ve already done, so you don’t do them again the next time.\n\nThe levels of understanding apply to the code your team owns as well, not just code you copy paste, or ‘inherit’ from others. Ideally, you ought to have a level 2 understanding of your team’s code, and a level 3 understanding of code you own. This understanding is building a mental model of how the code works.\n\nI’ve noticed that code reviews help a lot in building this mental model. I do as many reviews as I can: it keeps me in the loop for what my team is working on. There’s also a very interesting feedback mechanism built in to this. I can judge how well I understand the code by my review comments. The less familiar I am with the code base, the more trivial my comments. As my mental model improves, I start seeing the system as a whole and how this new part will interact with everything else. I can spot inconsistencies, and figure out when something wouldn’t work. When I start making comments like these, I know I’m inching towards a level 2-3 understanding.\n\nSince the code is always evolving, this is a constant process: your understanding can go up and down depending on how out of touch you get.\n\nAnother reason to get a level 2-3 understanding is to seek inspiration. When you understand the code of a new system, you figure out what decisions they made, and why. This increases your repertoire of things to work with12. This is one big reason why I dived into Unix, and wrote about how it works. This is also a very good reason to understand the tools you use, which is why I learned how Git works\n\n\n\nTo summarize:\n\n\n  Don’t write code you don’t understand\n  Prioritise learning whenever possible\n  Preserve context for future you\n  Aim for a level 2-3 understanding of code your team owns\n  Code reviews help keep your mental models up to date\n\n\nTesting\n\nSay you build a new system, and testing reveals it to be too slow. You designed it considering how long each component would take, but looks like some of your assumptions failed you. What’s the next thing you do?13\n\nI would measure how long each component takes to identify where I can make the biggest impact. Some things are indeed out of your control, like the request latency. You’re probably not going to launch a satellite to make your code faster. Measuring timing and figuring out where you can improve is critical.\n\nI’ve tried going in guns blazing, optimising whatever looks suboptimal to me, like converting dicts to sets - but the final solution is usually never this obvious. Dicts are probably not the reason your request is taking a second longer.14\n\n\n  Measure instead of assuming.\n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nIn last year’s review, I wrote:\n\n\n  If there’s an environment mismatch between test and deploy machines, you’ll be in trouble. And here’s where deployment environments come in. […] The idea is to try and catch errors that unit and system testing wouldn’t. For example, an API mismatch between requesting and responding system.\n\n\nI didn’t quite appreciate a clean testing environment until it bit me. By clean, I mean it replicates your prod environment completely. It allows you to test exactly what will happen in prod. Of course, you don’t need a physical machine, docker works well here.\n\nI’ve found docker to be one of the biggest productivity tools for testing. It allows me to whip up new environments, test things locally, and reduces friction. This fast feedback loop allows me to develop quicker. It’s frustrating when I have to wait 5-10 minutes to check if I deployed well, trigger a test, check outputs, etc. Docker is all of that, right on my machine.\n\nOne final thing I learned was to optimise for zero false positives. It’s easy to write tests that pass without testing what you intended to. For example, iterating through a database cursor and checking the values? Well if the iterator returns nothing, your test has passed without checking anything.\n\nThese are false positives, and they’re sinister for giving you a false sense of confidence. How do I fix these? Well, I start by being extra careful during code reviews. The second, sure-fire way of testing this is to make your tests fail. I switch around an equals to a not-equals. If tests still pass, I have a problem. This is something I’ve started doing recently, once I saw my first false positive.\n\nIn summary:\n\n\n  With optimisation problems, measure instead of assuming.\n  Have a clean staging environment. Containerisation is cool.\n  Optimise for 0 false positives.\n\n\nDesign\n\nAlmost every system design is about trade-offs. The good engineers make these trade-offs explicit.\n\nThese trade-offs rise out of the constraints on us and on the product we want.\n\nSpeaking of, requirements and constraints are not the same. Constraints are real world limits. For example, we can’t send messages from New York to Australia in 1 millisecond, yet. There are also product constraints, like we don’t want users to see more than 3 pop ups any time.\n\nRequirements, on the other hand, are flexible. They are things we want to happen, but often times we don’t know what we want. Asking myself “what am I really trying to do?” helps uncover the constraints from the requirements. Usually, people jump too quickly into the requirements - which is just one of the many possible paths from the constraints. So, whenever I feel the requirements don’t make sense, I go back the constraints and reason up to reach alternative requirements. I learned to do this from my PM - he’s excellent! - and from @shreyas Twitter threads.15\n\n\n  There’s no holy grail design that will always work\n\n\n\n\nWhen designing systems, I’ve noticed two broad themes.\n\nThe first is that there are a limited number of components we’ve invented: queues, caches, databases, and connectors (or code to make them work together). Every possible design is a permutation of these components - each of which present their own trade-offs. Some are much faster, some are much more maintainable, and some are much more scalable, depending on your use-case.\n\nGiven your constraints, one arrangement will be better than the other. Your goal is finding that arrangement. From time to time, there are brilliant hacks you can do to reduce complexity, or make things faster. However, the basic infrastructure doesn’t change.\n\nThe second is that everyone has a few happy-themes to go back to, which they’ve seen work well in the past. These are different lenses to look at the system. Design is about figuring out which permutations conform to this lens.\n\nFor example, I love reducing state and keeping things simple. Reducing state helps me reason better about systems, and helps me write better tests. Same for keeping things simple. Both lead to fewer bugs. Of course, it can’t be too simple: it can’t violate the constraints.\n\nLike I said last year, it’s worth thinking about speed, as well as local development and testing. If two designs are equivalent, but one is much easier to setup locally and write tests for, I’ll almost always choose the one that’s easier to write tests for.\n\nI like figuring out other people’s lenses, and try to adopt lenses I don’t have. That’s another reason I read tech blogs.\n\n\n\nWhen designing, it’s worth preserving context too, just like when writing code. Often times, I’ve seen myself come back to very old code, forget the assumptions we had then, and think “Wtf, why did we do it like this?!”. Making our constraints and trade-offs explicit helps keep things in perspective, and helps judge whether you made the right decision.\n\nFinally, when designing systems that replace existing systems, I find it very important to talk about the migration paths: How will we manage moving from the old system to new system?\n\nIf you’ve ever noticed a system with half of the things running on the new code, and half on the old code, that’s a flawed migration path. Not thinking about the migration path leads to mounting tech debt: you now have to manage and maintain both the new and the old systems. Sometimes, this happens because priorities switch, and you’re left in the middle. In either case, these abnormalities don’t age well.\n\nGood migration paths that might take longer than a sprint take into account the state they leave the system in. If priorities change, will we get stuck in a state where we can’t do anything? Or is our migration incremental, which is robust to changing priorities? Of course, the incremental migration isn’t always the right solution. Sometimes, the clean break is a lot easier. The important part there is communicating well: we can’t deal with changing priorities for this migration.\n\nIn summary:\n\n\n  Every system design is about trade-offs.\n  There’s limited technical components to every design.\n  People have definite lenses with which they approach design, just like mental models.\n  Preserve context when designing: write down your constraints and trade-offs.\n  When replacing old systems, have a clear migration path.\n\n\nGathering Requirements\n\nGoing with the above theme, gathering requirements is actually gathering constraints. Like we saw above, requirements are sometimes a translation of the constraints into tech requirements, which isn’t always the way to go forward.\n\nIn my team culture, there’s enough trust in both the team and the PM that we’re free to challenge each other on this. Asking the question suffices.\n\nA checklist of questions works well here. Here are some questions I ask frequently\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nThis final section dives into a few gotchas, some things I did wrong, and a summary of everything that went right.\n\nSome hacks that have worked very well for me\n\n\n  Doing as many code reviews as possible. The more you miss, the wronger your mental model for the code becomes, and the more time it takes you to figure out how to design the new thingy.\n  Playing the meta: An important second question to ask is “How did you find out X?”, where X is the answer to your first question.\n  The first person to review my PRs is… me. Always. I like doing this a lot. It’s something I learned from writing: The first phase is writing out the substance, the second phase is editing for flow. It’s similar in code. Code review is the edit phase, and doing this on my code makes me better at writing code, noticing inconsistencies, and figuring out how others would approach the review.\n\n\nSuper powers\n\nJust like in a video game, there are a few power ups you can obtain. These help give you powers in the real world. \nJust like in a video game, you need to go on quests to obtain them.\n\nHere are a few I’ve discovered, and possible quests to get them through.\n\n\n  Getting into the source code when documentation isn’t enough\n    \n      Quest: Reading open source code.\n    \n  \n  Quickly build a mental model for the code you’re looking at\n    \n      Quest: Reading open source code.\n    \n  \n  Embracing fear\n    \n      Quest: Build a side project.\n    \n  \n  Confidence to express ignorance\n    \n      Quest: Overcome the first gotcha with growing.\n    \n  \n  Defining my terms. Letting people know exactly what I’m talking about. Like I mentioned in an Idea Muse article a few weeks ago: “Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about.”\n    \n      Quest: ???\n    \n  \n\n\nSome gotchas with growing\n\nJust as engineers appreciate documentation that includes common gotchas, I think people appreciate reading about common gotchas with growing - mistakes I noticed myself making, and then corrected.\n\nSometimes, I feel I need to know the answer to everything\n\nAs I figure out more things, more people reach out to me with questions. This feels great! However, there are bound to be questions I don’t know the answer to. In this case, chasing the feeling, and feigning intelligence is a trap. A trap that stops me from learning.\n\nWill people stop coming to me if I say I don’t know? Probably not.\n\nFurther, they’re going to find out the answer anyway, since they’re competent and smart too. How dumb would it be to not soak in that knowledge too?\n\nConfidence to express ignorance is a super power.\n\nOne good way I hone this skill is by saying “Nothing to add” when I have nothing to add, instead of repeating what other people said. It feels powerful to me. I got this one from Charlie Munger.\n\nSometimes, I lose my cool\n\nThere are some times when I enter the panic & frustration mode. I stop reasoning about things rationally and write whatever garbage I can to solve the problem. Add a call, add a bracket, print random stuff, just get things to run some way. This usually starts when it takes me longer than expected to fix something.\n\nHere’s a concrete example. I was working on tests for a new queue system we built, and I wanted to simulate starving and competing queue consumers. So, I decided to spawn several threads in the test, all running the consumer, which would run for 5 seconds, competing for one single message in the queue. I’d expect only one of them to get the message (that’s the queue semantics we implemented). And I’d expect none of them to crash.\n\nFor the test, I joined the threads with a timeout of 5 seconds. These tests didn’t seem to work. I tried simulating things manually, and everything would work as expected. But with the threads, sometimes the tests would fail. I couldn’t figure this out. I tried every random thing I could. In one great moment of desperation, I re-ordered the tests. It felt funny doing this, how could this possibly help? Turns out, the first test passed again, and the other one, which was passing beforehand started failing.\n\nThis is when I noticed I had lost my cool, trying random things that didn’t make sense. I calmed down, and started investigating what was happening in the threads. Turns out, join just waits, and doesn’t kill the process even after timeout. terminate() is what kills the process. If I had taken the time to read the docs properly, I wouldn’t have felt so frustrated.\n\nThe threads weren’t being terminated, and these orphans would mess with the following tests.\n\nUsually, this happens when I’m in a rush, when I haven’t protected my slack, and as a result I’m not prioritising learning over doing. Other times, it’s because it’s a hard piece of code, and no low-hanging fruit solved the problems.\n\nNoticing I’m doing this is usually enough to snap me out of it. I move from ad-hoc bug fixing to strategic bug fixing.\n\nNeophilia\n\nIt’s easy to take optimising learning over doing too far. For example, making the wrong design decisions to try out a new technology. I keep myself in check thanks to our team culture. We challenge each other’s decisions, and realise when we have no good reason to explain it, there’s a latent desire - which we then make explicit.\n\nA concrete way I do this: When figuring out pros and cons for a design, I explicitly mention “this would be cool to learn”, so this desire stops hiding behind flimsy reasons.\n\n\n  Make decisions for the right reasons, not to try something new out\n\n\nAdding a new technology to the team stack is a big decision, one not to be taken lightly.\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nQuestions\n\nTo extend last year’s list, there are a few questions I don’t yet have the answer to.16 I’d like to think more about these this year.\n\n\n  \n    How do you build a culture which promotes X, Y, Z?\n  \n  \n    How do you judge culture fit? Hard to do top-down predictions when things are built bottom up.\n  \n  \n    I suspect being precise with your words is yet another super power. It’s effective communication + communicating the right thing. What’s one quest I can do to hone this?\n  \n  \n    What are some open problems in software engineering?\n  \n\n\nand some questions from last year that I’d still like to think about\n\n\n  \n    How to deal with documentation for code and workflows?\n  \n  \n    Explore De-risking further. What all strategies exist to de-risk projects?\n  \n  \n    How to decrease rate of system degradation?\n  \n\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nMy first year was all about absorbing all I could. I didn’t know enough to see the system, I could only see the parts. This year, I took a gods eye view to the system. I figured out places where I was suboptimal and worked on those. I looked at other parts of the system, absorbed their best practices, and become wary of practices that didn’t work for me.\n\nOver time I started looking inward for things I’m doing right, and before I knew it, others started seeing me as a senior software engineer.17\n\nDamn, I love engineering.\n\n\n    \n    \n    \n    \n    \n\n\nIf you’re looking for a summary to remember this post by, read software engineering skills.\n\n\n  Thanks to Hung for reading drafts of this.\n\n\n  \n    \n      Also, probably the first thing I learned this year was to use the American spelling of ‘learned’ (not ‘learnt’), since most readers are from the States and some of them freaked out on HN and Reddit when they saw ‘learnt’. Funny. ↩\n    \n    \n      I haven’t stopped learning about these, I’ve just taken different approach. More on this in acquiring new tools for thought. ↩\n    \n    \n      My interpretation, not representing my employers. Same for the entire article. ↩\n    \n    \n      Except for a few system inefficiencies. ↩\n    \n    \n      Affiliate link ↩\n    \n    \n      Like when you know exactly what you’re doing and you’ve done it a few times before. ↩\n    \n    \n      Just communicating is probably not enough in certain team cultures. I haven’t been a part of one like this yet, so I don’t know how to help there. ↩\n    \n    \n      Again, caveats apply. For example, having slack is not an excuse to go fix that damn bug that irritates you - that’s a proper story / KTLO item. There are good and bad ways to use up your slack. I prefer using slack for understanding depth of the current issue / new tech / etc. ↩\n    \n    \n      Read more: Julia Evans on asking good questions. ↩\n    \n    \n      One way to hack this would be to start getting fearful of the smallest things, but I’ve never been able to control what I’m afraid of, so I think I’m safe here. ↩\n    \n    \n      read: I can protect my slack ↩\n    \n    \n      Tools for thought! ↩\n    \n    \n      Not rhetorical, I’d love to hear from you! ↩\n    \n    \n      Not usually, anyway. ↩\n    \n    \n      You should go follow Shreyas! ↩\n    \n    \n      After all, questions are more important than answers. ↩\n    \n    \n      No, I don’t have the title yet. ↩",

Because I use Grav rather than Hugo as my CMS I couldn’t just steal Ana's template, but I was more than happy to base my front matter directly on her’s.\n\nThe relevant section of the YAML front matter for the latest book is:  \nbook:\n    title: \"All the Light We Cannot See\"\n    author: \"Anthony Doerr\"\n    url: \"https://bookshop.org/books/all-the-light-we-cannot-see/9781501173219\"\n    year: \"2017\"\n    started: \"2020-07-01\"\n    finished: \"2020-07-23\"\n    rating: \"5\"\n    image: \"all-the-light-we-cannot-see.jpg\"\nAnd the Twig partial template is:  \n<div class=\"h-cite bookcard flex\" >\n<div class=\"book-cover\">\n<a href={{ page.header.book.url }} class=\"u-uid\"><img src =\"{{ page.url ~ '/' ~ page.header.book.image }}\" alt=\"Book cover\"></a>\n</div>\n<p class=\"book-data\">\n<span class=\"p-item h-product\">\n<a href={{ page.header.book.url }}>{{ page.header.book.title }}</a></br>\nby {{ page.header.book.author }}</br>\nPublished: {{ page.header.book.year }}</br>\n</span>\nRead from: {{ page.header.book.started|date(\"d M\") }} to {{ page.header.book.finished|date(\"d M\") }}</br>\n<data class=\"p-rating\" value=\"{{ page.header.book.rating }}\">My rating: \n{% for i in 1..page.header.book.rating %}\n 🌟\n{% endfor %}\n</data>\n</p>\n</div>\nThat seems a lot more complex than the Hugo template, but it isn’t really, just different (although I am bit jealous of that string.Repeat function).\nI’m very happy with the outcome, and I think I even got the microformats correct; thanks to Ana for inspiration. Now I “just” need to update all my existing reviews. With a snippet to inject the required details, I’m hoping it won’t take long and that I have no excuses for not writing more about the books I’ve read.\nAlso posted on IndieNews.",

This was supported by my <a href=\"https://vincentp.me/articles/2020/07/16/16-20/https://github.com/vipickering/mastr-cntrll\">IndieWeb server</a> running on NodeJs on Heroku which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Listened for webmentions, POSTing them in to the Github API (triggering a redeploy with the content added).</li>\n<li>Sent webmentions by recieving a GET request on deploy from Netlify, then polling an RSS feed for content before forwarding content to <a href=\"https://vincentp.me/articles/2020/07/16/16-20/https://telegraph.p3k.io/\">Telegraph</a> for sending.</li>\n<li>Recieved Micropub content, formatting in to Markdown and POSTing in to the Github API  (triggering a redeploy with the content added).</li>\n<li>Recieved Media (it only supports jpg images at present) and POSTs in to the Github API  (triggering a redeploy with the content added).</li>\n<li>Recieved checkins via ownyourswarm and converting to markdown posts and POSTs in to the Github API  (triggering a redeploy with the content added).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I would syndicate content by using an XML feed that was periodically polled by Zapier and that would send content to various places.</p>\n<p>It all worked but it was incredibly brittle. Problems ranged from:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I broke webmentions in any way, or the server went down, the trigger from Netlify would fire 10 times then silently fail (cmon Netlify at least tell me something went wrong!). Causing a backlog.</li>\n<li>Something broken in one area of the NodeJs server would mean other functionality could stop working as well. (I may have been able to isolate my code and handle it better, but there is only so much free time I have)</li>\n<li>Hard to extend the code. Partly I had a messy codebase, but also when your service “does all the things” it leads to complexity in handling those things and accounting for all the consequences. Less is better and encapsualted code is even better.</li>\n<li>Things doing multiple things, leading to collisions or race conditions.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Complexity was also a big driver,  I don’t tinker in the code constantly, so even with good naming conventions and logic it can lead to accidentally missing unintended consequences around changing behaviour.</p>\n<h2 id=\"learning\" tabindex=\"-1\">Learning</h2>\n<p>I have written in the past around the possibility of combining Lambda functions (or Netlify functions) in to my process. My theory was that on deploying the website, the functions would fire and do things like send a webmention or syndicate content.\nThis was to reduce complexity by moving code from Mastr Cntrl and in to simple “single purpose” functions.</p>\n<p>I’ll cut to the chase here. I managed to write a working Netlify function that would send webmentions and another that would syndicate content similar to <a href=\"https://vincentp.me/articles/2020/07/16/16-20/https://mxb.dev/blog/syndicating-content-to-twitter-with-netlify-functions/\">Max Böck’s example here</a>. It wasn’t a fun process at all however. The Netlify Dev CLI was incredibly buggy. I had to re-install Node multiple times, reauthentice and numerous other issues. I burned through hours and hours of free time I couldn’t really spare.</p>\n<p>The buggy CLI aside (which I assume will be fixed at some point) I didn’t proceed with this direction for bigger reasons.\nOnce I had the code working I took a step back and realised I had begun to build a dependancy in my build process.

      "content-plain": "This post is part of a series where you can follow along as I redesign the blog and my IndieWeb Server.\nQuick recap on my old architecture\nA year ago I began a journey to really rethink how Indieweb functionality could work with a static website.\nThe hardest part to this process was the architecture, technically I need to be able to create an easy to support system, that is simple to deploy but flexible to allow me to do the interesting things I want to do with data.\nI think (finally!) the major technical work is coming to an end so I wanted to share my thought process and learnings from what I have done.\n My old architecture \nOriginally I had my static site deploying to Netlify. This was supported by my IndieWeb server running on NodeJs on Heroku which:\n\nListened for webmentions, POSTing them in to the Github API (triggering a redeploy with the content added).\nSent webmentions by recieving a GET request on deploy from Netlify, then polling an RSS feed for content before forwarding content to Telegraph for sending.\nRecieved Micropub content, formatting in to Markdown and POSTing in to the Github API  (triggering a redeploy with the content added).\nRecieved Media (it only supports jpg images at present) and POSTs in to the Github API  (triggering a redeploy with the content added).\nRecieved checkins via ownyourswarm and converting to markdown posts and POSTs in to the Github API  (triggering a redeploy with the content added).\n\nI would syndicate content by using an XML feed that was periodically polled by Zapier and that would send content to various places.\nIt all worked but it was incredibly brittle. Problems ranged from:\n\nIf I broke webmentions in any way, or the server went down, the trigger from Netlify would fire 10 times then silently fail (cmon Netlify at least tell me something went wrong!). Causing a backlog.\nSomething broken in one area of the NodeJs server would mean other functionality could stop working as well. (I may have been able to isolate my code and handle it better, but there is only so much free time I have)\nHard to extend the code. Partly I had a messy codebase, but also when your service “does all the things” it leads to complexity in handling those things and accounting for all the consequences. Less is better and encapsualted code is even better.\nThings doing multiple things, leading to collisions or race conditions.\n\nComplexity was also a big driver,  I don’t tinker in the code constantly, so even with good naming conventions and logic it can lead to accidentally missing unintended consequences around changing behaviour.\nLearning\nI have written in the past around the possibility of combining Lambda functions (or Netlify functions) in to my process. My theory was that on deploying the website, the functions would fire and do things like send a webmention or syndicate content.\nThis was to reduce complexity by moving code from Mastr Cntrl and in to simple “single purpose” functions.\nI’ll cut to the chase here. I managed to write a working Netlify function that would send webmentions and another that would syndicate content similar to Max Böck’s example here. It wasn’t a fun process at all however. The Netlify Dev CLI was incredibly buggy. I had to re-install Node multiple times, reauthentice and numerous other issues. I burned through hours and hours of free time I couldn’t really spare.\nThe buggy CLI aside (which I assume will be fixed at some point) I didn’t proceed with this direction for bigger reasons.\nOnce I had the code working I took a step back and realised I had begun to build a dependancy in my build process. When I set out on the path to include Indieweb functionality I always took the approach, that it was the content I wanted to own, not the process.\n\n\nIndieweb approaches may fall out of favour, the web could change radically, the future is unknown. I want to keep the separation of my static site and not intertwine the logic of these processes. It is one of the reasons I offload the creation of Micropub posts to my server and deliver the static file as if I had created it.\nAt a later date I may want to abandon Indieweb and if I ever chose to do so it should be simple and easy to walk away from. Otherwise I am no better than the platforms I am “liberating” my content from.\n\n\nA personal coding thing, perhaps its my experience level, I really didn’t like the way Lambda functions are formed and how they work. It all just felt a bit wrong and this needs to be at least enjoyable to do or I will get bored and go do something else.\n\n\nYou can only run the code for certain conditions. I wanted an “always on” system, which would mean further splitting up my code but not in a logical way. Sending would work, recieving would need to be handled a different way, probably by a separate server or process.\n\n\nI would encourage you to explore Netlify functions for yourself and decide if they (can or would) work for you. They didn’t meet my needs, but they might be exactly what you are looking for. Plenty of people are happy using them!\nMoving to Microservices\nOnce I decided that lambda functions were not right for me, I began to reassess the best way to reduce complexity, eventually deciding upon a Microservices approach.\nI decided upon separating my concerns in to the following:\n\nA service to handle Micropub  (recieving content and formatting it)\nA service to handle Webmentions (sending and recieving)\nA service to syndicate content\n\nI could go further and have 2 separate services to send and recieve webmentions etc. My experience with Microservice arhcitecture has been that it pays to break them down and keep them simple within reason.

Algorithms now prioritize content from people with a huge following and everything that is loud and outrageous. It’s all about what the masses and the bots “want”, what they will like, share, and click. This strategy might be driving sales of ads because traditional online marketers are obsessed with quantity and it is – besides selling user data – the only answer they found for venture capital constantly demanding a bang for the buck. Yet it leads to an experience that is so often just more of the same and at the same time much less predictable, less organic, and less adjustable to your own preferences. As <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://craigmod.com/essays/newsletters/\">Craig Mod writes</a>, “social networks seem more and more to say: You don’t know what you want, but we do.”</p>\n\n<p>Consequently, it has become substantially harder for people with a small to medium following to get their voices heard and find a practical and creative use for services like Twitter or Medium. Twitter, for example, used to be that place where you would meet nice and brilliant people from the web community and make new friends, where you could find and share ideas and inspiration. But Twitter has changed so drastically and I’ve seen so many people turning quiet or leaving completely, that I don’t know how long this journey will continue. As with so many technologies before, the initial hopeful enthusiasm that accompanied the rise of social media has given way to disillusionment.</p>\n\n<p>One day, Twitter and other publishing platforms like Facebook, Instagram, or Medium will indeed die, <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://indieweb.org/site-deaths\">like so many sites before them</a>. And every time this happens, we lose most of the content we created and with it a fair amount of our collective cultural history. </p>\n\n<p>Data loss isn’t our only problem, though. If you decide to publish your work on a platform like Medium, you’re giving away control over it. What if Medium suddenly decided to extend the already existing paywall to all articles? There’s not much you could do about it. Simply because you don’t own your content anymore.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe this wouldn’t be a big issue if owning your content today wasn’t more important than ever. Especially, but not only, if you are working as an independent or freelancer, your content is not just something you happen to have created – and for which you own the copyright of, by the way – but it is also part of your identity. It is part of who you are, what you’re thinking about, what you believe in, and what you’re up to. It is part of the story you are about to tell. It is part of the change you seek to make. Your content is one of your most valuable assets and thus owning it is invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>So it comes as no surprise that more and more people are looking for alternatives. Not only for alternatives to Twitter or Medium per se but to the way social media currently works in general. Many are craving for more control, less noise, and for having more real and meaningful conversations again.</p>\n\n<h2>Homecoming</h2>\n\n<p>There is one alternative to social media sites and publishing platforms that has been around since the early, innocent days of the web. It is an alternative that provides immense freedom and control: The personal website. It’s a place to <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://matthiasott.com/notes/out-there\">write, create, and share whatever you like</a>, <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/http://brendandawes.com/blog/permission-to-write-anything\">without the need to ask for anyone’s permission</a>. It is also the perfect place to explore and try new things, because, as Seth Godin likes to say, we now live in a <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://matthiasott.com/notes/unlimited-bowling\">world of “unlimited bowling”</a>. It is totally up to you what you create and because you have unlimited shots on the Web, you can try out different formats, different styles, different topics. Regardless of what other people might think and although it might not work. Creation is free.</p>\n\n<p>A personal website is also a powerful playground to tinker with new technologies and discover your powers. Take <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://rachelandrew.co.uk/archives/2017/01/05/its-more-than-just-the-words/\">Rachel Andrew’s</a> and Sara Soueidan’s word for it:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">- My first <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://twitter.com/hashtag/CSS?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#CSS</a> Grid implementation was on my own site<br>- My first service worker implementation was on my own site<br>- My first real-world CSS Variables implementation was/is on my own site (WIP)<br>- My first Variable Fonts implementation will be on my own site<br>- ...</p>— Sara Soueidan (@SaraSoueidan) <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://twitter.com/SaraSoueidan/status/1093781826815119360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script> \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t    \t\t\t\t    \t\t      \t    \t<p>I couldn’t agree more. Building things for your own site is so worthwhile because you are allowed to make mistakes and learn without pressure. If it doesn’t work today, well, maybe it’ll work tomorrow. It doesn’t matter. And so it was on my own site that I, too, wrote my first service worker, that I first tried out CSS Grid, that I designed and implemented a <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://matthiasott.com/notes/colorful-code-adding-syntax-highlighting\">custom syntax highlighting theme</a>, that I set up an <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://matthiasott.com/notes/adding-json-feed-to-my-craft-cms-site\">RSS/Atom and JSON feed</a>, that I wrote three plugins for Craft CMS in PHP/<a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://www.yiiframework.com/\">Yii</a>, and <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://https://twig.symfony.com/\">Twig</a>, with one of those plugins <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://github.com/matthiasott/webmention\">adding Webmention support to my site</a>. I also learned a ton about accessibility, performance optimization, or web font loading. All of which I then could put to use in my day-to-day work as a designer and developer.</p>\n\n<p>But maybe the most compelling reason why a personal website and also learning how to build one is incredibly valuable is this: community. Since the days of “guest books”, personal websites have been a place to receive feedback and discuss ideas and concepts with others. Often by the means of comments, sometimes even by writing a series of follow-up articles back and forth.</p>\n\n<p>Now imagine, for a moment, an environment where a decentralized fabric of connected personal sites allows everyone to publish their own content but also enables each individual to engage in an open discussion – answering, challenging, and acknowledging the ideas of others through this universe of personal sites. </p>\n\n<p>As idealistic as this vision of the Web might seem these days, it isn’t that far out of reach. Much of what’s needed, especially the publishing part, is already there. It’s also not as if our sites weren’t already connected in one way or another. Yet much of the discussions and establishment of connections, of that social glue that holds our community together – besides community events in real life, of course –, mostly happens on social media platforms at the moment. But: this is a choice. If we would make the conscious decision to find better ways to connect our personal sites and to enable more social interaction again, and if we would then persistently work on this idea, then we could, bit by bit, influence the development of Web technologies into this direction. What we would end up with is not only a bunch of personal websites but a whole interconnected personal-website-verse.</p>\n\n<h2>Weaving Our Web</h2>\n\n<p>It’s, of course, safe to assume that a web of personal websites will never be an equivalent substitute for a social network like Twitter. But that’s also not the goal. Personal websites are called personal websites because they are just that: personal. Thus, the primary objective still is to have a place to express ourselves, to explore ourselves, a place that lasts while the daily storms pass by. A place of consideration, and yes, a place of proudly sharing what we do, what we think, and what we care about. A place to contribute your voice and help others. A home on the internet. A place to tell <em>your</em> story.</p>\n\n<p>But on top of that, we have the chance to (re-)establish personal websites also as central elements of online discourse and as entry points for people who are new to the web community. For this, we need to find ways to create an ecosystem that lives up to the diversity of the personal-website-verse. Consequently, what will hold our sites together, is most possibly not one technology to rule them all, but a multitude of different and ever-evolving technologies. Things like hyperlinks, comments, Webmentions, and RSS, of course, but also other technologies that have yet to be invented. Not only would this leave enough room for individual preferences, but it would also make the whole construct more resilient while still being flexible enough to evolve over time. </p>\n\n<p>The first step of this is to explore more ways to establish new and strengthen existing connections – and also to improve findability. We don’t have to reinvent everything from scratch but can build on so much that already exists. Some things that can serve as good starting points are:</p>\n\n<h3>Quote people and link to other sites.</h3>\n\n<p>Whenever you stumble upon an interesting thought on another site, write about it and link to it. Not only is it respectful to link to the person you quoted, but hyperlinks are also the magic force holding the Web together. They are both helpful and powerful. You can also add a links section to your site, where you collect interesting links you found on the web and over time build an archive for yourself and others.</p>\n\n<p>By the way: What happened to the blogroll? Remember? That little box in the sidebar of blogs that would link to the websites of friends and fellow bloggers. The blogroll isn’t dead yet – some people still use it. So how about adding a little section or page to your site that does exactly the same? Link to the personal websites of people you respect and appreciate, maybe with a little description? While we’re on it, we could also <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://bryanlrobinson.com/blog/2019/02/07/bring-fansites-back-to-the-web/\">bring webrings back</a>. Charlie Owen recently also wrote <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://www.sonniesedge.net/posts/webrings\">about them</a> and Max Böck <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://mxb.dev/blog/webring-kit/\">was so inspired he built a starter kit for hosting your own webring</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Use RSS feeds and readers.</h3>\n\n<p>RSS has been pronounced dead over and over again, yet it is still not dead and I doubt that it ever will be. In fact, it is witnessing a little comeback from time to time. Personally, I have started to use it more regularly again and others have, too. RSS is a great way to follow the people whose posts, ideas, and opinions matter to you. So if you write or put any kind of content on your site, also make sure to add an RSS feed. And then go and add some sites to a feed reader like <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://feedbin.com/\">Feedbin</a>, <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://feedly.com\">Feedly</a>, or Michael Scharnagl’s <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://feediary.com/\">Feediary</a>. If you use a Mac or iOS device, also have a look at <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/http://reederapp.com/\">Reeder</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Use website directories.</h3>\n\n<p>There are a few really helpful directories that list RSS feeds or personal sites and that can help you find interesting content. For example, Andy Bell’s <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://personalsit.es/\">personalsit.es</a>, Dave Winer’s <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/http://feedbase.io/\">feedbase</a>, the <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://indieweb-directory.glitch.me/\">IndieWeb Directory</a>, or RSS lists like the ones of <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://github.com/simevidas/webplatformnews-feeds/blob/master/feeds.opml\">Sime Vidas</a> or <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://github.com/sturobson/myRSS/blob/master/subscriptions.xml\">Stuart Robson</a>.</p>\n\n<h3>Use Webmentions and Microformats – and join the IndieWeb.</h3>\n\n<p>Another powerful technology which can glue our sites together is <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://indieweb.org/webmention\">Webmention</a>. Webmention <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://www.w3.org/TR/webmention/\">is a W3C recommendation</a> that describes a simple protocol to notify any URL when a website links to it, and for web pages to request notifications when somebody links to them. The mentioned site can then grab a snippet of the HTML of the website that links to it and, if it is enriched with <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/http://microformats.org\">Microformats</a>, display the mention somewhere, for example under a blog post like this one. Aside from all questions of data protection, Webmentions are a powerful tool and one of the many technologies that originated in the IndieWeb community. If you don’t know about the IndieWeb yet, take a look at <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://matthiasott.com/articles/going-indie-reclaiming-content\">my article on reclaiming control over your content</a>, or head over to <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://indieweb.org\">indieweb.org</a>. Built around the basic idea that you should own your content, the IndieWeb community is the birthplace of a few powerful technologies that all have the goal to make your personal website the center of a more open, decentralized web.</p>\n\n<p>Webmentions are a great way to connect and intertwine two sites and thus, two ideas. You could even build something like a commenting system around Webmention – if only it still wasn’t a bit complicated for mere mortals to implement them. Luckily, there are plugins available for content management systems like <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://github.com/pfefferle/wordpress-webmention\">Wordpress</a>, <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://github.com/gRegorLove/ProcessWire-Webmention\">ProcessWire</a>, or <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://docs.grabaperch.com/addons/blog/webmentions/\">Perch</a>. I will update my own <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://github.com/matthiasott/webmention\">Webmention plugin for Craft CMS</a> over the coming weeks so that it supports the latest version 3 of Craft CMS.</p>\n\n<h3>Go to meetups and conferences and spread the word.</h3>\n\n<p>There are meetups for everything and they are a great place to meet like-minded people, exchange, connect, and tell others about how great having a personal website is. So look up if there’s maybe a meetup about blogging in your city. Also, meetups on topics like WordPress, writing, or publishing in general could be worth a visit. Then there are more and more <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://indieweb.org/Homebrew_Website_Club\">Homebrew Website Clubs</a> emerging. Homebrew Website Clubs, which are also an IndieWeb idea, are a great opportunity to work with others on your personal sites once or twice a month. And if you don’t find an appropriate meetup or event near you, how about starting one? </p>\n\n<h2>“Don’t do it like me. Do it like you.”</h2>\n\n<p>As you can see, there are many ways and many good reasons to start building your site today. But whatever you start, keep in mind that you don’t have to build something from start to finish to show it to the world. To the contrary, it can be a great idea to start as simple and rudimentary as possible, to get the fundamentals right before diving too deep into over-complicated solutions. Take your time to think about how to build a site that’s truly tailored to you and your work. What are you really trying to achieve? What content do you want to create? Who is your audience? And how does a website look like that reflects all that in terms of structure, hierarchy, complexity, visual design, and scope?</p>\n\n<p>Kylie Timpani, for example, who <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://css-tricks.com/design-v17/\">recently worked as the lead designer on v17 of CSS-Tricks</a>, is now <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://dribbble.com/shots/5993693-Personal-Website-2019-WIP-001-In-the-Wild\">doing an open redesign of her website</a>. So she is building the website out in the open, starting with some blank and raw HTML, and will be documenting what she’s learning along the way. This, by the way, is generally a great thing to do on your site: Document your process and share all the things you learn. <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://amberwilson.co.uk\">Amber Wilson is doing this on her site</a>, too. Since she decided to become a web developer, she regularly writes about her experience and <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/wilt100days/\">what she learned</a>. Not only is this a great way to help others find their way, but it also shows that we all have to learn and we all have things we don't know. Don’t let that stop you.</p>\n\n<p>Also, don’t hesitate to write about little ideas and observations that might seem too small or unimportant to share. We all have our unique perspectives and even the smallest experience is worth sharing. Someone else might be in a similar situation as you or also in a completely different situation. They both might learn something new from reading about your experiences. Each contribution to the community, even the smallest one, is useful and will make a change. So <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://www.sarasoueidan.com/desk/just-write/\">just write</a>. By the way: If you are struggling to find something to write about and feel blocked, remember that there is <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://itunes.apple.com/de/podcast/akimbo-a-podcast-from-seth-godin/id1345042626?l=en&amp;mt=2&amp;i=1000405208122\">no such thing as writer‘s block</a>. The more you write and create, the easier it will get.</p>\n\n<h2>To Begin, Begin</h2>\n\n<p>When I studied design back in the early 2000s, my digital media professor, Tom Duscher, held the view that every designer should have their own blog. It was still the early days of blogging but he already saw the potential and power of writing about your craft and reflecting on your experiences. At the time, I thought I understood what he meant, but it took me over 10 years to finally overcome (or simply ignore) the fear of being wrong and start to publish on my site. I won’t ever look back.</p>\n\n<p>Building and maintaining your personal website is an investment that is challenging and can feel laborious at times. Be prepared for that. But what you will learn along the way does easily make up for all the effort and makes the journey more than worthwhile. But most importantly, having a website makes you part of an amazing community of creators, forming new friendships, new connections, and new opportunities. This is invaluable.</p>\n\n<p>Personal websites are the backbone of the independent Web of creators. Even after all those years, they remain a vital part of what makes the web the most remarkable and open medium to date. We shouldn’t take this for granted, though. If we don’t pay enough attention and care about the open web enough, we might lose this valuable asset. So let us protect the Web as a source of inspiration, diversity, creativity, and community. Let us maintain what we have and work together to make this little part of the magic of the Web sparkle even brighter. Let us help new members of the community to start their journey. Let us build, prototype, publish, and connect.</p>\n\n<p>Let’s start today.</p>\n\n<p>If you start a new personal site or already have one, you are welcome to share it below. There are three ways to do that:\nIf your site supports that, just send a Webmention via your personal website. You can also use the form below this article to send a Webmention. Then, you can reply to <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/articles/into-the-personal-website-verse/https://twitter.com/m_ott/status/1127504584262463488\">this tweet</a> – all replies are automatically added to this article as a Webmention.

Building things for your own site is so worthwhile because you are allowed to make mistakes and learn without pressure. If it doesn’t work today, well, maybe it’ll work tomorrow. It doesn’t matter. And so it was on my own site that I, too, wrote my first service worker, that I first tried out CSS Grid, that I designed and implemented a custom syntax highlighting theme, that I set up an RSS/Atom and JSON feed, that I wrote three plugins for Craft CMS in PHP/Yii, and Twig, with one of those plugins adding Webmention support to my site. I also learned a ton about accessibility, performance optimization, or web font loading. All of which I then could put to use in my day-to-day work as a designer and developer.\n\nBut maybe the most compelling reason why a personal website and also learning how to build one is incredibly valuable is this: community. Since the days of “guest books”, personal websites have been a place to receive feedback and discuss ideas and concepts with others. Often by the means of comments, sometimes even by writing a series of follow-up articles back and forth.\n\nNow imagine, for a moment, an environment where a decentralized fabric of connected personal sites allows everyone to publish their own content but also enables each individual to engage in an open discussion – answering, challenging, and acknowledging the ideas of others through this universe of personal sites. \n\nAs idealistic as this vision of the Web might seem these days, it isn’t that far out of reach. Much of what’s needed, especially the publishing part, is already there. It’s also not as if our sites weren’t already connected in one way or another. Yet much of the discussions and establishment of connections, of that social glue that holds our community together – besides community events in real life, of course –, mostly happens on social media platforms at the moment. But: this is a choice. If we would make the conscious decision to find better ways to connect our personal sites and to enable more social interaction again, and if we would then persistently work on this idea, then we could, bit by bit, influence the development of Web technologies into this direction. What we would end up with is not only a bunch of personal websites but a whole interconnected personal-website-verse.\n\nWeaving Our Web\n\nIt’s, of course, safe to assume that a web of personal websites will never be an equivalent substitute for a social network like Twitter. But that’s also not the goal. Personal websites are called personal websites because they are just that: personal. Thus, the primary objective still is to have a place to express ourselves, to explore ourselves, a place that lasts while the daily storms pass by. A place of consideration, and yes, a place of proudly sharing what we do, what we think, and what we care about. A place to contribute your voice and help others. A home on the internet. A place to tell your story.\n\nBut on top of that, we have the chance to (re-)establish personal websites also as central elements of online discourse and as entry points for people who are new to the web community. For this, we need to find ways to create an ecosystem that lives up to the diversity of the personal-website-verse. Consequently, what will hold our sites together, is most possibly not one technology to rule them all, but a multitude of different and ever-evolving technologies. Things like hyperlinks, comments, Webmentions, and RSS, of course, but also other technologies that have yet to be invented. Not only would this leave enough room for individual preferences, but it would also make the whole construct more resilient while still being flexible enough to evolve over time. \n\nThe first step of this is to explore more ways to establish new and strengthen existing connections – and also to improve findability. We don’t have to reinvent everything from scratch but can build on so much that already exists. Some things that can serve as good starting points are:\n\nQuote people and link to other sites.\n\nWhenever you stumble upon an interesting thought on another site, write about it and link to it. Not only is it respectful to link to the person you quoted, but hyperlinks are also the magic force holding the Web together. They are both helpful and powerful. You can also add a links section to your site, where you collect interesting links you found on the web and over time build an archive for yourself and others.\n\nBy the way: What happened to the blogroll? Remember? That little box in the sidebar of blogs that would link to the websites of friends and fellow bloggers. The blogroll isn’t dead yet – some people still use it. So how about adding a little section or page to your site that does exactly the same? Link to the personal websites of people you respect and appreciate, maybe with a little description? While we’re on it, we could also bring webrings back. Charlie Owen recently also wrote about them and Max Böck was so inspired he built a starter kit for hosting your own webring.\n\nUse RSS feeds and readers.\n\nRSS has been pronounced dead over and over again, yet it is still not dead and I doubt that it ever will be. In fact, it is witnessing a little comeback from time to time. Personally, I have started to use it more regularly again and others have, too. RSS is a great way to follow the people whose posts, ideas, and opinions matter to you. So if you write or put any kind of content on your site, also make sure to add an RSS feed. And then go and add some sites to a feed reader like Feedbin, Feedly, or Michael Scharnagl’s Feediary. If you use a Mac or iOS device, also have a look at Reeder.\n\nUse website directories.\n\nThere are a few really helpful directories that list RSS feeds or personal sites and that can help you find interesting content. For example, Andy Bell’s personalsit.es, Dave Winer’s feedbase, the IndieWeb Directory, or RSS lists like the ones of Sime Vidas or Stuart Robson.\n\nUse Webmentions and Microformats – and join the IndieWeb.\n\nAnother powerful technology which can glue our sites together is Webmention. Webmention is a W3C recommendation that describes a simple protocol to notify any URL when a website links to it, and for web pages to request notifications when somebody links to them. The mentioned site can then grab a snippet of the HTML of the website that links to it and, if it is enriched with Microformats, display the mention somewhere, for example under a blog post like this one. Aside from all questions of data protection, Webmentions are a powerful tool and one of the many technologies that originated in the IndieWeb community. If you don’t know about the IndieWeb yet, take a look at my article on reclaiming control over your content, or head over to indieweb.org. Built around the basic idea that you should own your content, the IndieWeb community is the birthplace of a few powerful technologies that all have the goal to make your personal website the center of a more open, decentralized web.\n\nWebmentions are a great way to connect and intertwine two sites and thus, two ideas. You could even build something like a commenting system around Webmention – if only it still wasn’t a bit complicated for mere mortals to implement them. Luckily, there are plugins available for content management systems like Wordpress, ProcessWire, or Perch. I will update my own Webmention plugin for Craft CMS over the coming weeks so that it supports the latest version 3 of Craft CMS.\n\nGo to meetups and conferences and spread the word.\n\nThere are meetups for everything and they are a great place to meet like-minded people, exchange, connect, and tell others about how great having a personal website is. So look up if there’s maybe a meetup about blogging in your city. Also, meetups on topics like WordPress, writing, or publishing in general could be worth a visit. Then there are more and more Homebrew Website Clubs emerging. Homebrew Website Clubs, which are also an IndieWeb idea, are a great opportunity to work with others on your personal sites once or twice a month. And if you don’t find an appropriate meetup or event near you, how about starting one? \n\n“Don’t do it like me. Do it like you.”\n\nAs you can see, there are many ways and many good reasons to start building your site today. But whatever you start, keep in mind that you don’t have to build something from start to finish to show it to the world. To the contrary, it can be a great idea to start as simple and rudimentary as possible, to get the fundamentals right before diving too deep into over-complicated solutions. Take your time to think about how to build a site that’s truly tailored to you and your work. What are you really trying to achieve? What content do you want to create? Who is your audience? And how does a website look like that reflects all that in terms of structure, hierarchy, complexity, visual design, and scope?\n\nKylie Timpani, for example, who recently worked as the lead designer on v17 of CSS-Tricks, is now doing an open redesign of her website. So she is building the website out in the open, starting with some blank and raw HTML, and will be documenting what she’s learning along the way. This, by the way, is generally a great thing to do on your site: Document your process and share all the things you learn. Amber Wilson is doing this on her site, too. Since she decided to become a web developer, she regularly writes about her experience and what she learned. Not only is this a great way to help others find their way, but it also shows that we all have to learn and we all have things we don't know. Don’t let that stop you.\n\nAlso, don’t hesitate to write about little ideas and observations that might seem too small or unimportant to share. We all have our unique perspectives and even the smallest experience is worth sharing. Someone else might be in a similar situation as you or also in a completely different situation. They both might learn something new from reading about your experiences. Each contribution to the community, even the smallest one, is useful and will make a change. So just write. By the way: If you are struggling to find something to write about and feel blocked, remember that there is no such thing as writer‘s block. The more you write and create, the easier it will get.\n\nTo Begin, Begin\n\nWhen I studied design back in the early 2000s, my digital media professor, Tom Duscher, held the view that every designer should have their own blog. It was still the early days of blogging but he already saw the potential and power of writing about your craft and reflecting on your experiences. At the time, I thought I understood what he meant, but it took me over 10 years to finally overcome (or simply ignore) the fear of being wrong and start to publish on my site. I won’t ever look back.\n\nBuilding and maintaining your personal website is an investment that is challenging and can feel laborious at times. Be prepared for that. But what you will learn along the way does easily make up for all the effort and makes the journey more than worthwhile. But most importantly, having a website makes you part of an amazing community of creators, forming new friendships, new connections, and new opportunities. This is invaluable.\n\nPersonal websites are the backbone of the independent Web of creators. Even after all those years, they remain a vital part of what makes the web the most remarkable and open medium to date. We shouldn’t take this for granted, though. If we don’t pay enough attention and care about the open web enough, we might lose this valuable asset. So let us protect the Web as a source of inspiration, diversity, creativity, and community. Let us maintain what we have and work together to make this little part of the magic of the Web sparkle even brighter. Let us help new members of the community to start their journey. Let us build, prototype, publish, and connect.\n\nLet’s start today.\n\nIf you start a new personal site or already have one, you are welcome to share it below. There are three ways to do that:\nIf your site supports that, just send a Webmention via your personal website. You can also use the form below this article to send a Webmention. Then, you can reply to this tweet – all replies are automatically added to this article as a Webmention. Or, write me a quick email and I’m happy to manually add your site below.\n\n–\n\nThe header image illustration is based on photographs of the Apple Lisa by Victor R.

The websites of today are primarily built with efficiency and usefulness in mind, but in turn, they often lack the creativity, playfulness, and dedication that make a site stand out and a joy to interact with.</p>\n\n<p>What happened to the rampant playfulness of the early web and the Flash era? Back in the late 90s and early 2000s, the visual language of the Web was still developing but also so refreshing. Almost every website – even though a fair amount looked quite questionable by today’s standards – had their very own character and distinct charm to it. Now, almost <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/fussy-web-true-meaning/https://modus.medium.com/on-the-visual-weariness-of-the-web-8af1c969ce73\">all websites look the same</a>. How did we end up here?</p>\n\n<p>In the search for answers, it makes sense to take a look back at the history of a related profession that once faced a similar challenge: graphic design. After the iconic graphic designer <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/fussy-web-true-meaning/https://matthiasott.com/notes/milton-glaser-ten-things-i-have-learned\">Milton Glaser died this Friday</a>, I listened to a few interviews he gave over the last years. At one point, he talked about how he perceived the state of graphic design earlier in his career, in the late 1960s. After the constructivists and modernists had dominated the visual language of design for several decades, everyone was striving to create design that was rational, functional, and formalistic. Design that was aimed at accomplishing a specific goal. Design that was promotional and persuasive. For him, this wasn’t enough. He wanted to create design work that would also speak to the other, the emotional part of the brain. Design that would tell a story and create affection, just like art. Affection not only for the work itself but also for the world at large.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/fussy-web-true-meaning/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFu_Y6sa98w\">According to Milton Glaser</a>, <em>“the most corrosive thing about the relationship between design and the public has been the idea that design is a manifestation of promotion and advertising.”</em>  And the marketing people, who came to dominate the landscape, were looking only into the past, trying to collect metrics that would reduce uncertainty and risk. As a result, design had become merely a means to an end.</p>\n\n<p>It seems to me that the same can be said of today’s Web: Websites are primarily seen as functional software, built to fulfill a business objective and to reach quantifiable goals. The field of user experience is obsessed with KPIs, jobs-to-be-done, optimized user flows, and conversion rates. And in quest of ever more efficient processes – and in the spirit of true modernists –, design and development teams try to standardize solutions into reusable templates and components, streamlined pattern libraries, and scalable design systems. Don’t get me wrong: The establishment of design systems, of all the professionalization that has happened in the web design community at large, is a great thing. It’s an important advancement of a still very young profession. But maybe we are now at a point, where we must acknowledge that it is time for us to take the next step. We know how to design and build sites that have sufficient function and form. And, although <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/fussy-web-true-meaning/https://webaim.org/projects/million/\">we fall short in this regard</a>, building performant and accessible sites should be perfectly doable by now, too. But this isn’t enough. We have to go beyond that. We have to take risks, tell stories, do the fussy work, and create affection to do work that does not only meet standards but exceeds expectations and surprises. We have to <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/fussy-web-true-meaning/https://matthiasott.com/notes/go-deep\">go deep</a> and use our imagination. Not only for ourselves, but for the people who get to use our sites. And for the next generation of designers, developers, and creators on the Web – all those people who might fall in love with the Web, just like we did.</p>\n\n<p>Who could explain it better than, once more, <a href=\"https://matthiasott.com/notes/fussy-web-true-meaning/https://soundcloud.com/designmatters/design-matters-with-debbie-91\">Milton Glaser in an interview with Debbie Millman</a>:</p>\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t    \t    \t\t\t\t\t\t\t    \t<blockquote><p>In early life, […] we wanted to be professional, and we wanted our work to look professional.

Or an expressive drawing? Or a drawing that means something? Because the ability simply to make it accurate is a low-level ability. Even though it has taken you years to get to that point.

The Four Horsemen of this emerging Textopia are: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://roamresearch.com/\">Roam</a>, a hypertext publishing platform best understood as a medium for composing conspiracy theories and extended universes.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://substack.com/\">Substack</a>, a careful and thorough ground-up neoclassical reconstruction of the age-old email newsletter.</li><li>Static websites, built out of frameworks like <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://jekyllrb.com/\">Jekyll</a> or <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/http://gatsbyjs.org\">Gatsby</a> (full disclosure: a consulting client).</li><li>And finally, <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205983999274840064\">Threaded Twitter</a>, a user-pioneered hack-turned-supported feature that has wonderfully revitalized the platform.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to take a stab at lightly theorizing this renaissance.  And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of blogging. And the future of books. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy hot take on the State of Textual Media. Or at least a simmering take, since I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a year on the backburner.</p>\n\n\n\n<span id=\"more-7047\"></span>\n\n\n\n<p>The text renaissance is an actual <em>renaissance. </em>It’s a story of history-inspired renewal in a very fundamental way: exciting recent developments are due in part to a new generation of young product visionaries circling back to the early history of digital text, rediscovering old, abandoned ideas, and reimagining the bleeding edge in terms of the unexplored adjacent possible of the 80s and 90s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I imagine, to traditionalists already bemoaning the slow decline of print-based media like books, newspapers, and magazines, these technologies I want to talk about might seem like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. But whether they strike you as renaissance or apocalyptic technologies, they’re here, so let’s meet them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Roam</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Roam attempts to implement a near-full conception of hypertext as originally conceived by visionaries like Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now. It’s a revelation what a thoughtfully implemented version of a powerful vision can do to unexpectedly transform something you think you understand deeply at a <em><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl\">Fingerspitzengefühl</a></em> (finger-tips feeling) level, like I think I do writing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the surface, Roam looks like a cross between a slightly weird wiki and a note-taking tool like Evernote. It’s not. It implements a few key features of 1980s vintage hypertext visions — block-level addressability, transclusion (changes in referenced blocks being “transfer-included” wherever they are cited), and bidirectional linking — that utterly transform the writing experience at the finger-tips level. You end up organizing high-level structure as you work at fleshing out low-level chunks of information, because the UX collapses high and low-level thinking into a single behavior. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can write, structure, organize, refactor, bundle/unbundle, all in a single subconsciously learnable flow. You don’t have to think consciously about this: it gets compiled down to finger-tip skill as you use it. This is the sort of product I was dimly groping around for, and trying to build at Xerox 10 years ago. I wasn’t smart enough to pull it off, and back then, the technology wasn’t there either anyway. Now the tech is there, and there’s someone on the scene smart enough to pull it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I met up with Roam founder Conor White-Sullivan last week in San Francisco and had a nice long walk-and-talk chat around the Mission with him. People who pull off impressive  feats of visionary product engineering often don’t quite recognize what they’ve done, but that’s not the case with with Conor. He knows what he’s doing, he knows the history (aka <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze\">idea maze</a>) of the product he’s built, and he’s got the opinionated approach I look for when adopting a commercial product. He’s also nailed the essential message-of-the-medium use case of Roam: conspiracy theories. Or alternately, extended-universe building. We’re in a fake-news world and we might as well get good at it. <em>Good</em> in both senses of the term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can also do note-taking, workflows (like kinda-sorta competitor Notion), and wiki-like knowledge management, but those use cases are not as interesting to me. Conspiracy theories and extended universes, in the best senses of those terms — escaped reality construction might be the general category — is what Roam <em>wants </em>to be about. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The name, incidentally, is a play-on-words joke apparently. As in Rome wasn’t built in a day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Substack</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>RSS had its rise and fall, going from seemingly promising consumer technology to limited-use backend plumbing. Email has now decisively reclaimed its dominant role as the last mile of push communications.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email newsletters are as old as the internet, and as far as dinosaur technologies go, email appears to be unkillable. For a while it looked like Slack would do it, but sadly, Slack went too corporate to realize that possibility. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Email today is now less a communications medium than a communications compile target. It’s a clearinghouse technology. It’s where conversations-of-record go, where identity verification happens, where service alerts accumulate, and perhaps most importantly for publishers, where push-delivered longform content goes by default. It is distributed and federated, near universal, and is not monopolized by a single provider. Now that a constellation of other product categories have hived off around it in the last two decades, it’s finally finding its own true nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The publishing side though, has always been rather janky. In the 90s people ran their own list-servs.  In the aughts, as permission marketing took off and the spam wars started, traditional list-servs couldn’t really keep up and email newsletters became contested territory in the arms race between marketing-communications platforms like Mailchimp and spam-filter algorithms on email clients like Gmail. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the early tens, while blogging reigned and RSS was not dead yet as a consumer distribution mode, and twitter hadn’t become dominant in the link economy, email newsletters for <em>writing</em>, as opposed to marketing, languished. They became associated with desperation: spammy-hacky popups on sites trying to get your email by any means necessary. Permission marketing evolved from Seth Godin’s original noble conception to “Permission” marketing in scare quotes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reversal began with <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://tinyletter.com/\">TinyLetter</a>, but that got bought out by Mailchimp (and began to be viewed, correctly, as business-model compromised).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enter Substack.  Substack, by eschewing the marketing communications (MarCom) market entirely, and focusing on writers people actually wanted to read, reversed the perceptions of the technology. Instead of trying to scam people into giving you “permission” to send them emails, Substack said, why not charge them to subscribe.  I’ve moved 1 of my 2 active newsletters (Breaking Smart, with about 7300 subscribers) from Mailchimp to Substack, and started a new one there (Art of Gig, currently at 1756). I’ll probably move my auto-generated-from-RSS ribbonfarm newsletter there too. I’ve left it on MailChimp for the moment, because moving it would mean de-automating it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By offering a seamlessly integrated email, payment integration (Stripe is a big part of all these revolutions), and no-design-needed opinionated web presentation, Substack managed to basically resurrect a zombie category of text media that hadn’t really existed in this kind of pure form since the 90s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could kinda hack it together, but it was hardly easy. The case of OG pioneer of the sector, Ben Thompson, is the exception that proves the rule. His popular <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://stratechery.com/\">Stratechery</a> newsletter has great content, but is a technical Frankenstein composed of WordPress, Mailchimp, Memberful, and Stripe. I tried briefly to set up that configuration myself a few years ago, but gave up on it as too high-maintenance. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last week in San Francisco, I also dropped by the Substack offices to chat with founders Hamish McKenzie and Chris Best. As with Conor at Roam, I came away with the impression that they knew what they were doing, and had the right opinionated attitude towards it. They are also (wisely) hedged against email as the last mile, and are paying as much attention to the web experience as the email experience. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Substack is now a serious part of my own activities, including a serious part of my income. I’m currently making nearly $17,500/year off <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://artofgig.substack.com/\">Art of Gig</a>. I will definitely be doing more with the platform, the only question is how and when, not if.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Static Websites</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Static websites are of course, the original kind of website. The qualifier <em>static </em>wasn’t even necessary in the first few years as that was the only kind of website you <em>could </em>build. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the 90s, we had CGI (Common Gateway Interface) based dynamic websites. They were a horror to build and maintain (I worked for a major CGI-Perl era site briefly in 2000-01). CGI eventually evolved into the modern database driven website. Commonly using descendants of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql, Perl/PHP). Today the webserver might be Nginx instead of Apache, and the scripting layer might be Ruby or Python, and you might be running in some sort of container in the cloud instead of a Linux server you administer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But through nearly 25 years of evolution, the basic <em>idea </em>of a destination content website hasn’t really changed from a publisher point of view. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Websites have just gotten a lot more reliable, stable, and high-performance. And for most purposes, you don’t need to roll your own website. You can use something like WordPress that implements a content management solution using the LAMP stack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> And high-end technologies like CDNs (content delivery networks) are now a standard part of serious websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This website, for instance, runs on a hosted WordPress platform called WPEngine that costs an arm and a leg (more on that in a bit), but is high-performance, secure, includes a seamlessly integrated CDN, and doesn’t crash under big traffic spikes like the one I just experienced with the Internet of Beefs article. In the early years, ribbonfarm would promptly crash under mildly viral conditions. Today I pay an order of magnitude more for hosting, but basically don’t have to do any thinking or mucking about in the backend to keep things running. We’ve come a long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there is a sense in which this is a bad, baroque, equilibrium. If you open up the code view of any modern webpage, it will be an unreadable mess of javascript, html, and weird shit loaded from all over the place. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new static webpage model takes a fundamentally different approach. The name is deceptive. Though the page delivered is a clean, simple static page, the backend is, if anything, a hyper-dynamic stream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frameworks like Gatsby (founded by my longtime friends and new clients Kyle Matthews and Sam Bhagwat) essentially assemble pages together on the fly from all over the place, via a just-in-time compilation stream piping into React. The result is blazing-fast websites that can be changed easily, but <em>look</em> static. In particular, they can evolve too fast to run off a “backend database” as such. Instead they do something that looks more like using the entire cloudy internet as a backend. The “server” behind a Gatsby style page is more like a temporary cache and assembly/staging area than a traditional backend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What all this technical magic means for content publishers is that finally, after 20 years, there is now a real, serious alternative to WordPress for building content websites. It is an alternative in a real sense: it is a new medium from the publisher point of view, and you have to learn how to create content for it. While you <em>can </em>bolt it onto something like WordPress (what’s known as a headless-CMS strategy), that’s not the main attraction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I see several promising young writers already moving away from the blog as the main vehicle for online written expression, and building bespoke sites with weirder, more experimental structures, using Gatsby and its kin as the foundation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There has of course, always been a small subculture of diehard bare-metal-ists who eschewed the blogging stack in favor of rolling their own sites, no matter how complex things got, but this goes beyond such geekery for the sake of geekery. Now it’s geekery for the sake of creative optionality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike Roam or Substack, this is not yet an entirely consumer-friendly technology. So right now, though it is exploding in popularity, Gatsby is primarily being used by serious programmers, often in corporations or design shops. You have to get fairly hands-on, and the required skills are about 3x harder to learn than running your own blog was in 2007. I made a very simple Gatsby website on Github–&gt;Netlify just to try it out, and it’s certainly beyond both my interest level to properly learn, and aptitude level for web-tech to get good at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it’s going to get easier. Much easier. And then Interesting Times will ensue. The WordPress monoculture will start to shift and many more weird structures will begin to flourish.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Threaded Twitter</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Threaded Twitter is perhaps the most interesting and weird of the Four Horsemen of Textopia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the unwashed masses flock to non-textual media like TikTok, we Very Online cognoscenti know that Twitter is where all the  history-making, universe-denting social media action really is. It is as close to a pure ideas-commons/digital public as we’ll ever get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A big part of the reason Twitter has ascended to this position is threading. The idea (originally known as tweetstorming) was invented as a simple workaround hack by Marc Andreessen back in 2014, to get past the 140 character limit. But a bunch of young pioneers rapidly turned it into a creative medium in its own right. Visakan Veeraswamy is among the best known at this point (he’s publishing <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://gumroad.com/l/friendlynerdbook\">a whole book of his threads</a> which I suspect is a first for the medium), but there are several others. At some point Twitter grudgingly started supporting threading as a feature (and in the process took control of how threads were displayed, an annoying but reasonable move). Services like <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://threadreaderapp.com/\">Threadreaderapp</a> emerged to turn threads into longform documents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, I accidentally instigated what ended up becoming an entire festival of threading, which I retroactively dubbed Threadapalooza 2019. I basically challenged people to do 100-tweet threads (optionally, in the case of mutuals, based on prompts from me), using the popular <em>1 like = 1 tweet</em> protocol (which I didn’t invent, though many people assume I did). Here’s a <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1205983999274840064\">meta-thread of 100 threads</a> that I compiled. A lot of the content was genuinely spectacular. There were excellent threads on architecture, macroeconomics, Trump,  trauma and healing, and all sorts of other topics. Go browse the meta thread and read a few. If you’ve been thinking Twitter is a cesspool of civilizational decay, prepare to change your mind. It’s pretty much the center of the renaissance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My prompt went sort of viral, and several hundred more threads were created by people I don’t know. All in all, it was a wonderful outpouring of deep reserves of creativity and knowledge, the likes of which I haven’t seen online in a long time. Several participants turned their threads into blog posts, and in one case, <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://innovationatscale.substack.com/\">an actual newsletter</a> (on Substack!), so I’m kinda proud of what I managed to provoke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s hard to convey what the hell happened during the two weeks the event was live, if you weren’t on twitter. But with a spot of Tom-Sawyerish whitewash-the-fence flattery, bullying and cajoling, I got a bunch of people to join me in adding some meta-structure to the event, so on top of the threading frenzy, a sort of meta-event emerged.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It began with Dorian Taylor <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://gist.github.com/doriantaylor/f89caee7badb1581fd8b9799477fdcae\">writing a script to scrape the threads</a> into a data hairball, which many others used to create visualizations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Our Man in Russia, <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/http://orbides.org/\">Artem Litvinovich</a>, got in on the act and made a video showing how the action unfolded.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<span class=\"embed-youtube\" style=\"text-align:center; display: block;\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" class=\"youtube-player\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/zbvEUb5iok4?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" style=\"border:0;\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation\"></iframe></span>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Then Ian Johnson, d3 maven, created this <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/threadapalooza-2019\">really nice navigable dashboard-like view</a> of the event. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://observablehq.com/@enjalot/threadapalooza-2019\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"377\" src=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-1024x377.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7078\" srcset=\"https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-1024x377.png 1024w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-300x111.png 300w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-768x283.png 768w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-1536x566.png 1536w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/enjalot-1-2048x754.png 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Benson created a pretty consolidated visualization of the race:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"256\" src=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa-1024x256.jpeg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7079\" srcset=\"https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa-1024x256.jpeg 1024w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa-300x75.jpeg 300w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa-768x192.jpeg 768w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa-1536x384.jpeg 1536w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/pixlpa.jpeg 2000w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Lars E. Schonander <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://theaggregate.substack.com/p/the-aggregate-december-23rd-2019\">did some crunching</a> to create a whole bunch of more wonky visualizations of what happened: rate of Likes, Likes to Tweets ratio, a moving leaderboard etc. Here’s a sample:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"717\" src=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lars-1024x717.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7080\" srcset=\"https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lars-1024x717.png 1024w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lars-300x210.png 300w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lars-768x537.png 768w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/lars.png 1456w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>My own contribution to the meta-event, besides being the whitewashing-the-fence instigator and compiler of threads, was to do ongoing cheerleading featuring the mascot of the event, Ascii Text Critter. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"672\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/critter-672x1024.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7082\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the current state of the art. Threading is clearly a very rich and complex medium, with a huge amount of potential. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible. If an almost-accidental event with some random volunteer hacking can lead to such a rich expression of creativity in both content and container, there’s a lot more to explore and develop here. All the hacks people pulled together suggest that if the technology comes together in the right way, Threadapalooza could become the template of a whole new kind of virtual conference. If I were 20 years younger, I’d be trying to create a startup to build such a product. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given Twitter’s track record though, I’d bet that the threading revolution will not actually unfold on Twitter itself. There’s a 50-50 chance they will do something boneheaded to mess up the potential, and starve out any products that attempt to build anything good on the quicksand of insecure attachment that’s the Twitter API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So other products will actually take this energy places. But one way or another, the future is going to be threaded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My own personal attitude towards Twitter is one of continued bewilderment, though I’ve been on it since 2007 and have 4 accounts on it (the largest, @vgr, with &gt;30k followers at this point). I think I’m fairly good at twitter, but I still don’t quite know what I’m doing there or why. Perhaps that’s for the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Enablers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One reason all this is happening now is that a set of interesting enablers are emerging simultaneously, on technological, economic, and cultural fronts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Technology</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the technological front, we have: React, Graph databases, next-generation languages like Clojure (the language Roam is written in), and a shifting perception of Javascript: instead of being viewed as a janky front-end language, it is now viewed as a mature “low-level” language, available on both frontend and backend (via Node) that’s more a compile target than something you hand-code in. These technologies in turn rest on a new generation of hardware and cloud infrastructure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There may be more interesting pieces of the puzzle coming down the pipeline. For example, my buddy Dorian Taylor (who wrote the Threadapalooza scraper linked earlier) has been quietly <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://doriantaylor.com/the-symbol-management-problem\">building up a usable descendent of SemWeb technologies</a> for textual content management. There’s a lot more like this going on quietly in the background I think. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Machine-learning driven technologies that can really soup up text are almost here. Two in particular are worth watching:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Automated transcription</strong>: The podcast boom (and to a lesser extent, the video boom on YouTube) currently exists almost entirely as an artifact of two social phenomena: commuting and low-cognitive-demand chores, both of which call for a low-information-density ambient background information flow. It is the conversational equivalent of elevator music (convo-muzak? convozak?). When transcription gets good enough, it will create another feedstock for text, and the backward coupling will create a whole new subculture within audio/video, of creators who are solving for higher-information-density text distribution in addition to/instead of, ambient convozak. </li><li><strong>Machine-generated text</strong>: GPT-2 is a genuine breakthrough in text-generation. I’ve been trying, with the help of programmer collaborators, to turn myself into a bot for years now, and finally, with GPT-2, an algorithm can sort of <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://twitter.com/hashtag/vgr_gpt2?src=hashtag_click\">generate tweets that sound like me</a> (ht Will Darwin, <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.willdarwin.com/blog/machina-1/\">here’s how he did it</a>). It’s fascinating and surreal, and I can’t wait to properly integrate that into my writing somehow.</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<h3>Economics</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the economic front, it is hard to overstate the profound effect Stripe has had on at least the English-language content ecosystem. Thanks to the availability of a solid, trustworthy, and well-designed payment processing solution, a great many ideas that used to be hard, annoying, or impossible can now be tried out. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stripe is important because it allows content technologies and media to be built ground-up with monetization philosophy in place at the foundational level. It doesn’t have to be a janky bolted-on piece of the puzzle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ten years ago, payment integration models were so bad *cough Paypal cough* that it created an adverse selection effect on textual content: you had to <em>really, really </em>care more about money than writing to deal with the jankiness of it all. This meant, of course, that only the most mercenary and shallow content creators pursued monetization seriously. The positive impact of PayPal (and the PayPal mafia) is widely recognized. I think we’re only now beginning to recognize the negative externalities created by it being the main payment processor for 15 years. It took the rise of a better product to show us what good payment integration can do to media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now payments have basically been solved in a seamless enough way (modulo annoying EU GDPR crap) that it should lead to a different sort of flourishing. It won’t be the open, free as in beer/free as in speech text internet with an open source ethos inherited from open source code. But it will likely be something much bigger and more interesting once money flows get built into the plumbing deeply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s also crypto over the horizon, but that’s going to take another 5-6 years I think to truly affect the media landscape. I did some early experiments with ERC20 tokens and such, as did others, and it’s in the wait-and-watch category for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Culture</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>On the cultural front, thanks to the toxicity of the Internet of Beefs, and the rise of what I’ve called the Cozyweb, the zeitgeist is very friendly to content technologies that <em>don’t </em>attempt to “democratize broadcast reach” as it were. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A common feature of all four horsemen of the textopia, from the publisher point of view, is that they trade quantity for quality. You want a more controlled, better gated, more intimate, and more financial relationship, with smaller audiences. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want to get away from flash-flood virality and towards long-term relationships. I’ve written enough about this aspect elsewhere, so I won’t dwell on ot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The Eighth Death of Blogging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the destruction side of this cycle of creative destruction is blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The death of blogging has been announced routinely every couple of years since 2000, and since I’ve been participating, starting in 2007, I’ve always concluded the death-sayers were mistaken. We’re going through another such cycle now, but this time I think it really is different. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If blogging is a cat with nine lives, this is probably the eighth death.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest reason is operating cost at larger scales. WordPress now serves something like a third of all websites, last I checked, and is a highly complex beast of a CMS that can serve up photo portfolios, ecommerce sites, business websites, etc. It has evolved far beyond basic reverse-chronological RSS-spitting blogging. A vast universe of themes and plugins exists, as does a sophisticated managed hosting industry with staging, fault-tolerance, automated upgrades, solid security, integrated CDNs, etc. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s part of the problem. I use one such service, the Cadillac of such services in fact, WPEngine. Unfortunately, in the last 12 months, for the first time in over a decade (after my first couple of years), Ribbonfarm is going to post a small operating loss. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s a snapshot of the unit economics of running a site like this, which you should be able to parse if you’re marginally financially literate:</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"870\" height=\"595\" src=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPecon2.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7088\" srcset=\"https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPecon2.png 870w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPecon2-300x205.png 300w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPecon2-768x525.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 870px) 100vw, 870px\"><figcaption>Snapshot of hosting economics</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The headline is that with traffic roughly steady, operating costs have gone up 45% (largely due to WPEngine doubling its overage charges from $1 to $2 for every 1000 visits above your plan base), while my Amazon Affiliate income (my main offsetting revenue stream) has dropped by about 26% for unclear reasons. There’s a lot of band-aid fixes and optimizations possible (moving to a cheaper host, doing more with affiliate programs or advertising) but the writing on the wall is clear. This is no longer a cheap, indie-scale technology past a fairly modest success bar. One way or another, you’ll pay for the privilege of being a blogger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what traffic’s been up to in the meantime. You’d think it’s good news, but it’s not really. The huge spike is the <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/\">Internet of Beefs</a> article, my first hit of this magnitude in a few years (the last one was <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/\">The Premium Mediocre Life of Maya Millennial</a> in 2017). Without it, I’d probably not have gone into the red. A decade ago, I’d have been over the moon about it. Now I’m like, dammit, this screws up my operating cost structure and I don’t give a shit about the exposure anymore. The spike cost me $324 in overages last month alone. And so far, there’s been nothing in the profit column attributable to it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"681\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPeconomics.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-7087\" srcset=\"https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPeconomics.png 681w, https://206hwf3fj4w52u3br03fi242-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/WPeconomics-300x242.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 681px) 100vw, 681px\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>One element of my broader response to the declining marginal value of virality (both financial and psychological) has been <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/blogchains/\">my experimentation with blogchains</a>, a format that a handful of other bloggers have also adopted. I came up with it partly as an anti-viral strategy to actively curtail and reverse traffic growth. I didn’t want to unintentionally end up in a bleeding-red go-big-or-go-home regime, since I have no appetite to go big. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another is my experimentation with getting rid of headlines (ie a human-centric discovery/addressing/packaging layer). You might have noticed that I’m doing a new blogchain with titles in the format MJD xxxx. It’s the opposite of clickbait. It’s active click-hostility. Things without evocative names have less of a chance of going viral and causing big spikes in hosting costs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might sound stupidly self-sabotaging and/or snowflakey and/or humblebraggy, but I really don’t want the problem of managing a site where success in content terms might mean a choice between slow ruin and unsavory monetization models in financial terms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second/third order payoffs of exposure, consulting gigs etc. is not as worth it as you’d think. And it’s really not as easy to scale this sort of operation as you might think. Between sites of ribbonfarm scale, and the lowest tier of “professional” media sites that are effectively magazines with a writing staff, there is a nightmare zone where monetization is janky and hard, business models are unstable and ugly, relationships with audiences are in a Patreon-ish badlands zone of crowd-sourced thought policing, and the technical administrative work involved in keeping the whole thing going is annoying and unrewarding. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m still thinking through what to do about this situation and where to go next personally, in a way that allows me to write what I want, without creating a financial discipline management job for me I don’t want, or accidentally creating a media startup I don’t want to run.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Books, eBooks and Zines</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to round out this whistelstop tour of the textual media landscape with a very brief note on books and ebooks. I have self-published one print book (<em><a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/tempo/\">Tempo</a></em>), and <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://amzn.to/2HOm4Ki\">9 ebooks for the Kindle</a>. Together these net me a few hundred dollars a month in royalties. Decent pocket change, and far more than median traditionally published authors make, but it isn’t going to earn me any mansions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I’m being honest, books have become an increasingly unattractive medium for writers like me who primarily developed a voice online. I do not write (or want to write) things with large-scale mainstream appeal. I do not crave the cachet or mainstream legibility that comes with big-publisher-backed books. I have no interest in riding a bestseller to TED or Davos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More importantly, I don’t quite enjoy the experience of retreating for long periods to write 35k-100k words in open loop mode. I think my limit for open-loop writing is about 14k words. For the book on temporality I’m working on now, I’ll probably serialize it online in some form before trying to put it together as a book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The whole point of that 35k-100k open loop mode is to target <em>print</em> books, which have unit economics that lend themselves to 35k+ word dead-tree containers. I’m ambivalent at best about having my stuff available in that form factor. It’s not like I do richly illustrated or complex-layout types of writing. There’s really no good reason for most people to prefer paper for <em>my</em> writing, and several reasons against (paper books having net higher carbon footprints being one of them)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But worst of all, books are an absolute bitch to produce (whether you self-publish or work with a publisher), with print books being an order of magnitude more work, and coming with the additional burden of distribution risks. For someone spoiled for a decade by the experience of hitting a button to publish, it seems like a Sisyphean task with dubious rewards. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I typeset <em>Tempo</em> myself in LaTeX and then paid a friend (thanks Adam) to design and add a cover, fine tune the PDF for PoD print-stability, and generate the ebook for the Kindle. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the next two I hired a friend (thanks Jane) to go from database to html to LaTeX to ebook, eschewing the print option altogether. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next 6, another friend (thanks Jordan) set up a sort of ebook editorial-to-production assembly line for me, without LaTeX or PDF as an intermediate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>On my to-do list is to make that assembly line even more efficient, including creating the option of going to print-on-demand easily where that’s a good idea. It’s a problem startups etc have been attacking for a decade, and it’s still not close to good enough. Every year or two, some excited startup founder emails me promising to make me rich by book-izing my writing. They never have the solution and can rarely answer even my most basic questions. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tech part is getting slowly easier. Adding solid design and editorial production values is the hard part, since that’s not automatable yet, but it’s within reach. This whole area is something of an expertise area for me, since I worked on aspects of it for years at Xerox and produced a print-on-demand book way back in 2000. It’s a total grind of a problem. Eventually someone with a sufficiently big warchest will crack it properly. When that happens, I’ll be in line waiting. Until then, it’s a low-priority personal-hack problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are books worth it? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ebooks for sure. They allow for a kind of ludic reading experience that browsers and apps still don’t deliver. I don’t get much out of making them besides a small stream of money, but readers seem to appreciate them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Print books? The jury is out I think. I think print is worth it for comic books, art, photography, and complex textbooks. For anything else, ebook-by-default, print-by-exception might be a good standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I honestly wouldn’t care if I never appeared in print again, though my parents are hoping to see another print book out of me And many readers seem to have a kind of sentimentality about print that I don’t really share, but am happy to feed. I wouldn’t mind producing print books if it were technically trivial to do, financially lucrative compared to ebooks, and the carbon costs could be meaningfully mitigated. But it’s honestly not a high priority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’ve personally been using libraries a lot more in the last few years, for both print and ebooks. But increasingly, I don’t like either owning books, or getting print books from the library (who wants the flu germs). I think I’ve gone fundamentally digital-and-online at some deep amygdala level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I want to throw in a mention of zines. That’s one print format that <em>does </em>interest me. It seems like an intriguing new medium. Former ribbonfarm contributor Sonya is doing an experiment <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.sonyasupposedly.com/supposedly-zines/\">producing a zine a month</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zines are on my watchlist as an interesting medium. I have zero interest in the artisan production and fulfillment experience as a producer, but there’s something very zeitgeisty going on there. The message of that medium is interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Text in a Hypermedia Context</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Most attention in the consumer media technology world tends to focus on the latest, most sophisticated media that we can create with networked computing technologies. Right now, the mainstream technological frontier lies in encrypted p2p messaging (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram) and short-form video (TikTok). </p>\n\n\n\n<p>VR, AR, deepfakes (as a creative medium), and natural-language text-generation (in particular the deep learning algorithm known as GPT-2) are inching ever closer to the mainstream. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Podcasting is approaching a sort of maturation plateau with the rise of both sophisticated toolchains and maturing automated transcription technologies (such as <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/http://otter.ai\">otter.ai</a>). It’s where blogging was in 2012 or so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All that is important, very important. I’m personally invested in all of it. I have an experimental monologue podcast going over at <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://breakingsmart.substack.com/\">Breaking Smart</a>, with another conversational one in the pipeline. I am working on <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://simmer.io/@maze_project/~9fe36f74-a57d-133f-4d65-6765889892ed\">a VR game</a> with a couple of collaborators. And as I mentioned earlier, I have been trying to <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://twitter.com/vgr/status/1224862448630370304?s=20\">turn myself into a GPT-2 bot</a> (with <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.willdarwin.com/blog/machina-1/\">help from Will Darwin</a>). But in each case, those are evolving Version 0.1 stories. The focus is on the technology more than the content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Text though, is definitely going through a renaissance, and as primarily a producer of text, that’s what interests me the most. What comes out the other end may or may not look anything like blogging. It might be a case of a New Blogging as an Elder Medium in an explosion of new textual media. Or it might be a case of Blogging is Dead, Long Live Blogging. Or something else altogether.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right now, I’m actively trying to reimagine my whole junkyard of a mini media empire from the ground up, thematically, structurally, and financially. We’ll see what sort of new Cunning Plan™ I land on. The Four Horsemen of Textopia will certain play a growing part, as will some random mix of newer technologies. </p>\n<div class=\"sharedaddy sd-sharing-enabled\"><div class=\"robots-nocontent sd-block sd-social sd-social-icon-text sd-sharing\"><h3 class=\"sd-title\">Share this:</h3><div class=\"sd-content\"><ul><li class=\"share-twitter\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-twitter-7047\" class=\"share-twitter sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance?share=twitter\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Twitter\"><span>Twitter</span></a></li><li class=\"share-facebook\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-facebook-7047\" class=\"share-facebook sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance?share=facebook\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Facebook\"><span>Facebook</span></a></li><li class=\"share-pocket\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-pocket sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance?share=pocket\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on Pocket\"><span>Pocket</span></a></li><li class=\"share-email\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-email sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance?share=email\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to email this to a friend\"><span>Email</span></a></li><li class=\"share-print\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"\" class=\"share-print sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance#print\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to print\"><span>Print</span></a></li><li class=\"share-linkedin\"><a rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-shared=\"sharing-linkedin-7047\" class=\"share-linkedin sd-button share-icon\" href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance/https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/02/24/a-text-renaissance?share=linkedin\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Click to share on LinkedIn\"><span>LinkedIn</span></a></li><li class=\"share-end\"></li></ul></div></div></div>",
      "content-plain": "There is a renaissance underway in online text as a medium. The Four Horsemen of this emerging Textopia are: \n\n\n\nRoam, a hypertext publishing platform best understood as a medium for composing conspiracy theories and extended universes.Substack, a careful and thorough ground-up neoclassical reconstruction of the age-old email newsletter.Static websites, built out of frameworks like Jekyll or Gatsby (full disclosure: a consulting client).And finally, Threaded Twitter, a user-pioneered hack-turned-supported feature that has wonderfully revitalized the platform.\n\n\n\nI want to take a stab at lightly theorizing this renaissance.  And also speculating, in light of this renaissance, about what might be the eighth and penultimate death of blogging. And the future of books. So it’s going to be a sprawling, messy hot take on the State of Textual Media. Or at least a simmering take, since I’ve been thinking about this stuff for a year on the backburner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe text renaissance is an actual renaissance. It’s a story of history-inspired renewal in a very fundamental way: exciting recent developments are due in part to a new generation of young product visionaries circling back to the early history of digital text, rediscovering old, abandoned ideas, and reimagining the bleeding edge in terms of the unexplored adjacent possible of the 80s and 90s.\n\n\n\nI imagine, to traditionalists already bemoaning the slow decline of print-based media like books, newspapers, and magazines, these technologies I want to talk about might seem like the four horsemen of the apocalypse. But whether they strike you as renaissance or apocalyptic technologies, they’re here, so let’s meet them.\n\n\n\nRoam\n\n\n\nRoam attempts to implement a near-full conception of hypertext as originally conceived by visionaries like Vannevar Bush and Ted Nelson. I’ve been using it for a couple of months now. It’s a revelation what a thoughtfully implemented version of a powerful vision can do to unexpectedly transform something you think you understand deeply at a Fingerspitzengefühl (finger-tips feeling) level, like I think I do writing.\n\n\n\nOn the surface, Roam looks like a cross between a slightly weird wiki and a note-taking tool like Evernote. It’s not. It implements a few key features of 1980s vintage hypertext visions — block-level addressability, transclusion (changes in referenced blocks being “transfer-included” wherever they are cited), and bidirectional linking — that utterly transform the writing experience at the finger-tips level. You end up organizing high-level structure as you work at fleshing out low-level chunks of information, because the UX collapses high and low-level thinking into a single behavior. \n\n\n\nSo you can write, structure, organize, refactor, bundle/unbundle, all in a single subconsciously learnable flow. You don’t have to think consciously about this: it gets compiled down to finger-tip skill as you use it. This is the sort of product I was dimly groping around for, and trying to build at Xerox 10 years ago. I wasn’t smart enough to pull it off, and back then, the technology wasn’t there either anyway. Now the tech is there, and there’s someone on the scene smart enough to pull it off.\n\n\n\nI met up with Roam founder Conor White-Sullivan last week in San Francisco and had a nice long walk-and-talk chat around the Mission with him. People who pull off impressive  feats of visionary product engineering often don’t quite recognize what they’ve done, but that’s not the case with with Conor. He knows what he’s doing, he knows the history (aka idea maze) of the product he’s built, and he’s got the opinionated approach I look for when adopting a commercial product. He’s also nailed the essential message-of-the-medium use case of Roam: conspiracy theories. Or alternately, extended-universe building. We’re in a fake-news world and we might as well get good at it. Good in both senses of the term.\n\n\n\nIt can also do note-taking, workflows (like kinda-sorta competitor Notion), and wiki-like knowledge management, but those use cases are not as interesting to me. Conspiracy theories and extended universes, in the best senses of those terms — escaped reality construction might be the general category — is what Roam wants to be about. \n\n\n\nThe name, incidentally, is a play-on-words joke apparently. As in Rome wasn’t built in a day.\n\n\n\nSubstack\n\n\n\nRSS had its rise and fall, going from seemingly promising consumer technology to limited-use backend plumbing. Email has now decisively reclaimed its dominant role as the last mile of push communications.\n\n\n\nEmail newsletters are as old as the internet, and as far as dinosaur technologies go, email appears to be unkillable. For a while it looked like Slack would do it, but sadly, Slack went too corporate to realize that possibility. \n\n\n\nEmail today is now less a communications medium than a communications compile target. It’s a clearinghouse technology. It’s where conversations-of-record go, where identity verification happens, where service alerts accumulate, and perhaps most importantly for publishers, where push-delivered longform content goes by default. It is distributed and federated, near universal, and is not monopolized by a single provider. Now that a constellation of other product categories have hived off around it in the last two decades, it’s finally finding its own true nature.\n\n\n\nThe publishing side though, has always been rather janky. In the 90s people ran their own list-servs.  In the aughts, as permission marketing took off and the spam wars started, traditional list-servs couldn’t really keep up and email newsletters became contested territory in the arms race between marketing-communications platforms like Mailchimp and spam-filter algorithms on email clients like Gmail. \n\n\n\nIn the early tens, while blogging reigned and RSS was not dead yet as a consumer distribution mode, and twitter hadn’t become dominant in the link economy, email newsletters for writing, as opposed to marketing, languished. They became associated with desperation: spammy-hacky popups on sites trying to get your email by any means necessary. Permission marketing evolved from Seth Godin’s original noble conception to “Permission” marketing in scare quotes.\n\n\n\nThe reversal began with TinyLetter, but that got bought out by Mailchimp (and began to be viewed, correctly, as business-model compromised).\n\n\n\nEnter Substack.  Substack, by eschewing the marketing communications (MarCom) market entirely, and focusing on writers people actually wanted to read, reversed the perceptions of the technology. Instead of trying to scam people into giving you “permission” to send them emails, Substack said, why not charge them to subscribe.  I’ve moved 1 of my 2 active newsletters (Breaking Smart, with about 7300 subscribers) from Mailchimp to Substack, and started a new one there (Art of Gig, currently at 1756). I’ll probably move my auto-generated-from-RSS ribbonfarm newsletter there too. I’ve left it on MailChimp for the moment, because moving it would mean de-automating it.\n\n\n\nBy offering a seamlessly integrated email, payment integration (Stripe is a big part of all these revolutions), and no-design-needed opinionated web presentation, Substack managed to basically resurrect a zombie category of text media that hadn’t really existed in this kind of pure form since the 90s. \n\n\n\nYou could kinda hack it together, but it was hardly easy. The case of OG pioneer of the sector, Ben Thompson, is the exception that proves the rule. His popular Stratechery newsletter has great content, but is a technical Frankenstein composed of WordPress, Mailchimp, Memberful, and Stripe. I tried briefly to set up that configuration myself a few years ago, but gave up on it as too high-maintenance. \n\n\n\nLast week in San Francisco, I also dropped by the Substack offices to chat with founders Hamish McKenzie and Chris Best. As with Conor at Roam, I came away with the impression that they knew what they were doing, and had the right opinionated attitude towards it. They are also (wisely) hedged against email as the last mile, and are paying as much attention to the web experience as the email experience. \n\n\n\nSubstack is now a serious part of my own activities, including a serious part of my income. I’m currently making nearly $17,500/year off Art of Gig. I will definitely be doing more with the platform, the only question is how and when, not if.\n\n\n\nStatic Websites\n\n\n\nStatic websites are of course, the original kind of website. The qualifier static wasn’t even necessary in the first few years as that was the only kind of website you could build. \n\n\n\nIn the 90s, we had CGI (Common Gateway Interface) based dynamic websites. They were a horror to build and maintain (I worked for a major CGI-Perl era site briefly in 2000-01). CGI eventually evolved into the modern database driven website. Commonly using descendants of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql, Perl/PHP). Today the webserver might be Nginx instead of Apache, and the scripting layer might be Ruby or Python, and you might be running in some sort of container in the cloud instead of a Linux server you administer. \n\n\n\nBut through nearly 25 years of evolution, the basic idea of a destination content website hasn’t really changed from a publisher point of view. \n\n\n\nWebsites have just gotten a lot more reliable, stable, and high-performance. And for most purposes, you don’t need to roll your own website. You can use something like WordPress that implements a content management solution using the LAMP stack.\n\n\n\n And high-end technologies like CDNs (content delivery networks) are now a standard part of serious websites.\n\n\n\nThis website, for instance, runs on a hosted WordPress platform called WPEngine that costs an arm and a leg (more on that in a bit), but is high-performance, secure, includes a seamlessly integrated CDN, and doesn’t crash under big traffic spikes like the one I just experienced with the Internet of Beefs article. In the early years, ribbonfarm would promptly crash under mildly viral conditions. Today I pay an order of magnitude more for hosting, but basically don’t have to do any thinking or mucking about in the backend to keep things running. We’ve come a long way.\n\n\n\nBut there is a sense in which this is a bad, baroque, equilibrium. If you open up the code view of any modern webpage, it will be an unreadable mess of javascript, html, and weird shit loaded from all over the place. \n\n\n\nThe new static webpage model takes a fundamentally different approach. The name is deceptive. Though the page delivered is a clean, simple static page, the backend is, if anything, a hyper-dynamic stream. \n\n\n\nFrameworks like Gatsby (founded by my longtime friends and new clients Kyle Matthews and Sam Bhagwat) essentially assemble pages together on the fly from all over the place, via a just-in-time compilation stream piping into React. The result is blazing-fast websites that can be changed easily, but look static. In particular, they can evolve too fast to run off a “backend database” as such. Instead they do something that looks more like using the entire cloudy internet as a backend. The “server” behind a Gatsby style page is more like a temporary cache and assembly/staging area than a traditional backend.\n\n\n\nWhat all this technical magic means for content publishers is that finally, after 20 years, there is now a real, serious alternative to WordPress for building content websites. It is an alternative in a real sense: it is a new medium from the publisher point of view, and you have to learn how to create content for it. While you can bolt it onto something like WordPress (what’s known as a headless-CMS strategy), that’s not the main attraction.\n\n\n\nI see several promising young writers already moving away from the blog as the main vehicle for online written expression, and building bespoke sites with weirder, more experimental structures, using Gatsby and its kin as the foundation. \n\n\n\nThere has of course, always been a small subculture of diehard bare-metal-ists who eschewed the blogging stack in favor of rolling their own sites, no matter how complex things got, but this goes beyond such geekery for the sake of geekery. Now it’s geekery for the sake of creative optionality.\n\n\n\nUnlike Roam or Substack, this is not yet an entirely consumer-friendly technology. So right now, though it is exploding in popularity, Gatsby is primarily being used by serious programmers, often in corporations or design shops. You have to get fairly hands-on, and the required skills are about 3x harder to learn than running your own blog was in 2007. I made a very simple Gatsby website on Github–>Netlify just to try it out, and it’s certainly beyond both my interest level to properly learn, and aptitude level for web-tech to get good at.\n\n\n\nBut it’s going to get easier. Much easier. And then Interesting Times will ensue. The WordPress monoculture will start to shift and many more weird structures will begin to flourish.\n\n\n\nThreaded Twitter\n\n\n\nThreaded Twitter is perhaps the most interesting and weird of the Four Horsemen of Textopia. \n\n\n\nWhile the unwashed masses flock to non-textual media like TikTok, we Very Online cognoscenti know that Twitter is where all the  history-making, universe-denting social media action really is. It is as close to a pure ideas-commons/digital public as we’ll ever get.\n\n\n\nA big part of the reason Twitter has ascended to this position is threading. The idea (originally known as tweetstorming) was invented as a simple workaround hack by Marc Andreessen back in 2014, to get past the 140 character limit. But a bunch of young pioneers rapidly turned it into a creative medium in its own right. Visakan Veeraswamy is among the best known at this point (he’s publishing a whole book of his threads which I suspect is a first for the medium), but there are several others. At some point Twitter grudgingly started supporting threading as a feature (and in the process took control of how threads were displayed, an annoying but reasonable move). Services like Threadreaderapp emerged to turn threads into longform documents.\n\n\n\nIn December, I accidentally instigated what ended up becoming an entire festival of threading, which I retroactively dubbed Threadapalooza 2019. I basically challenged people to do 100-tweet threads (optionally, in the case of mutuals, based on prompts from me), using the popular 1 like = 1 tweet protocol (which I didn’t invent, though many people assume I did). Here’s a meta-thread of 100 threads that I compiled. A lot of the content was genuinely spectacular. There were excellent threads on architecture, macroeconomics, Trump,  trauma and healing, and all sorts of other topics. Go browse the meta thread and read a few. If you’ve been thinking Twitter is a cesspool of civilizational decay, prepare to change your mind. It’s pretty much the center of the renaissance.\n\n\n\nMy prompt went sort of viral, and several hundred more threads were created by people I don’t know. All in all, it was a wonderful outpouring of deep reserves of creativity and knowledge, the likes of which I haven’t seen online in a long time. Several participants turned their threads into blog posts, and in one case, an actual newsletter (on Substack!), so I’m kinda proud of what I managed to provoke.\n\n\n\nIt’s hard to convey what the hell happened during the two weeks the event was live, if you weren’t on twitter. But with a spot of Tom-Sawyerish whitewash-the-fence flattery, bullying and cajoling, I got a bunch of people to join me in adding some meta-structure to the event, so on top of the threading frenzy, a sort of meta-event emerged.\n\n\n\nIt began with Dorian Taylor writing a script to scrape the threads into a data hairball, which many others used to create visualizations.\n\n\n\nThen Our Man in Russia, Artem Litvinovich, got in on the act and made a video showing how the action unfolded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen Ian Johnson, d3 maven, created this really nice navigable dashboard-like view of the event. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAndrew Benson created a pretty consolidated visualization of the race:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLars E. Schonander did some crunching to create a whole bunch of more wonky visualizations of what happened: rate of Likes, Likes to Tweets ratio, a moving leaderboard etc. Here’s a sample:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy own contribution to the meta-event, besides being the whitewashing-the-fence instigator and compiler of threads, was to do ongoing cheerleading featuring the mascot of the event, Ascii Text Critter. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the current state of the art. Threading is clearly a very rich and complex medium, with a huge amount of potential. \n\n\n\nWe’ve barely scratched the surface of what’s possible. If an almost-accidental event with some random volunteer hacking can lead to such a rich expression of creativity in both content and container, there’s a lot more to explore and develop here. All the hacks people pulled together suggest that if the technology comes together in the right way, Threadapalooza could become the template of a whole new kind of virtual conference. If I were 20 years younger, I’d be trying to create a startup to build such a product. \n\n\n\nGiven Twitter’s track record though, I’d bet that the threading revolution will not actually unfold on Twitter itself. There’s a 50-50 chance they will do something boneheaded to mess up the potential, and starve out any products that attempt to build anything good on the quicksand of insecure attachment that’s the Twitter API.\n\n\n\nSo other products will actually take this energy places. But one way or another, the future is going to be threaded.\n\n\n\nMy own personal attitude towards Twitter is one of continued bewilderment, though I’ve been on it since 2007 and have 4 accounts on it (the largest, @vgr, with >30k followers at this point). I think I’m fairly good at twitter, but I still don’t quite know what I’m doing there or why. Perhaps that’s for the best.\n\n\n\nThe Enablers\n\n\n\nOne reason all this is happening now is that a set of interesting enablers are emerging simultaneously, on technological, economic, and cultural fronts.\n\n\n\nTechnology\n\n\n\nOn the technological front, we have: React, Graph databases, next-generation languages like Clojure (the language Roam is written in), and a shifting perception of Javascript: instead of being viewed as a janky front-end language, it is now viewed as a mature “low-level” language, available on both frontend and backend (via Node) that’s more a compile target than something you hand-code in. These technologies in turn rest on a new generation of hardware and cloud infrastructure. \n\n\n\nThere may be more interesting pieces of the puzzle coming down the pipeline. For example, my buddy Dorian Taylor (who wrote the Threadapalooza scraper linked earlier) has been quietly building up a usable descendent of SemWeb technologies for textual content management. There’s a lot more like this going on quietly in the background I think. \n\n\n\nMachine-learning driven technologies that can really soup up text are almost here. Two in particular are worth watching:\n\n\n\nAutomated transcription: The podcast boom (and to a lesser extent, the video boom on YouTube) currently exists almost entirely as an artifact of two social phenomena: commuting and low-cognitive-demand chores, both of which call for a low-information-density ambient background information flow. It is the conversational equivalent of elevator music (convo-muzak? convozak?). When transcription gets good enough, it will create another feedstock for text, and the backward coupling will create a whole new subculture within audio/video, of creators who are solving for higher-information-density text distribution in addition to/instead of, ambient convozak. Machine-generated text: GPT-2 is a genuine breakthrough in text-generation. I’ve been trying, with the help of programmer collaborators, to turn myself into a bot for years now, and finally, with GPT-2, an algorithm can sort of generate tweets that sound like me (ht Will Darwin, here’s how he did it). It’s fascinating and surreal, and I can’t wait to properly integrate that into my writing somehow.\n\n\n\nEconomics\n\n\n\nOn the economic front, it is hard to overstate the profound effect Stripe has had on at least the English-language content ecosystem. Thanks to the availability of a solid, trustworthy, and well-designed payment processing solution, a great many ideas that used to be hard, annoying, or impossible can now be tried out. \n\n\n\nStripe is important because it allows content technologies and media to be built ground-up with monetization philosophy in place at the foundational level. It doesn’t have to be a janky bolted-on piece of the puzzle. \n\n\n\nTen years ago, payment integration models were so bad *cough Paypal cough* that it created an adverse selection effect on textual content: you had to really, really care more about money than writing to deal with the jankiness of it all. This meant, of course, that only the most mercenary and shallow content creators pursued monetization seriously. The positive impact of PayPal (and the PayPal mafia) is widely recognized. I think we’re only now beginning to recognize the negative externalities created by it being the main payment processor for 15 years. It took the rise of a better product to show us what good payment integration can do to media.\n\n\n\nNow payments have basically been solved in a seamless enough way (modulo annoying EU GDPR crap) that it should lead to a different sort of flourishing. It won’t be the open, free as in beer/free as in speech text internet with an open source ethos inherited from open source code. But it will likely be something much bigger and more interesting once money flows get built into the plumbing deeply.\n\n\n\nThere’s also crypto over the horizon, but that’s going to take another 5-6 years I think to truly affect the media landscape. I did some early experiments with ERC20 tokens and such, as did others, and it’s in the wait-and-watch category for me.\n\n\n\nCulture\n\n\n\nOn the cultural front, thanks to the toxicity of the Internet of Beefs, and the rise of what I’ve called the Cozyweb, the zeitgeist is very friendly to content technologies that don’t attempt to “democratize broadcast reach” as it were. \n\n\n\nA common feature of all four horsemen of the textopia, from the publisher point of view, is that they trade quantity for quality. You want a more controlled, better gated, more intimate, and more financial relationship, with smaller audiences. \n\n\n\nYou want to get away from flash-flood virality and towards long-term relationships. I’ve written enough about this aspect elsewhere, so I won’t dwell on ot.\n\n\n\nThe Eighth Death of Blogging\n\n\n\nOn the destruction side of this cycle of creative destruction is blogging.\n\n\n\nThe death of blogging has been announced routinely every couple of years since 2000, and since I’ve been participating, starting in 2007, I’ve always concluded the death-sayers were mistaken. We’re going through another such cycle now, but this time I think it really is different. \n\n\n\nIf blogging is a cat with nine lives, this is probably the eighth death.\n\n\n\nThe biggest reason is operating cost at larger scales. WordPress now serves something like a third of all websites, last I checked, and is a highly complex beast of a CMS that can serve up photo portfolios, ecommerce sites, business websites, etc. It has evolved far beyond basic reverse-chronological RSS-spitting blogging. A vast universe of themes and plugins exists, as does a sophisticated managed hosting industry with staging, fault-tolerance, automated upgrades, solid security, integrated CDNs, etc. \n\n\n\nThat’s part of the problem. I use one such service, the Cadillac of such services in fact, WPEngine. Unfortunately, in the last 12 months, for the first time in over a decade (after my first couple of years), Ribbonfarm is going to post a small operating loss. \n\n\n\nHere’s a snapshot of the unit economics of running a site like this, which you should be able to parse if you’re marginally financially literate:\n\n\n\nSnapshot of hosting economics\n\n\n\nThe headline is that with traffic roughly steady, operating costs have gone up 45% (largely due to WPEngine doubling its overage charges from $1 to $2 for every 1000 visits above your plan base), while my Amazon Affiliate income (my main offsetting revenue stream) has dropped by about 26% for unclear reasons. There’s a lot of band-aid fixes and optimizations possible (moving to a cheaper host, doing more with affiliate programs or advertising) but the writing on the wall is clear. This is no longer a cheap, indie-scale technology past a fairly modest success bar. One way or another, you’ll pay for the privilege of being a blogger.\n\n\n\nHere’s what traffic’s been up to in the meantime. You’d think it’s good news, but it’s not really. The huge spike is the Internet of Beefs article, my first hit of this magnitude in a few years (the last one was The Premium Mediocre Life of Maya Millennial in 2017). Without it, I’d probably not have gone into the red. A decade ago, I’d have been over the moon about it. Now I’m like, dammit, this screws up my operating cost structure and I don’t give a shit about the exposure anymore. The spike cost me $324 in overages last month alone. And so far, there’s been nothing in the profit column attributable to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne element of my broader response to the declining marginal value of virality (both financial and psychological) has been my experimentation with blogchains, a format that a handful of other bloggers have also adopted. I came up with it partly as an anti-viral strategy to actively curtail and reverse traffic growth. I didn’t want to unintentionally end up in a bleeding-red go-big-or-go-home regime, since I have no appetite to go big. \n\n\n\nAnother is my experimentation with getting rid of headlines (ie a human-centric discovery/addressing/packaging layer). You might have noticed that I’m doing a new blogchain with titles in the format MJD xxxx. It’s the opposite of clickbait. It’s active click-hostility. Things without evocative names have less of a chance of going viral and causing big spikes in hosting costs.\n\n\n\nThis might sound stupidly self-sabotaging and/or snowflakey and/or humblebraggy, but I really don’t want the problem of managing a site where success in content terms might mean a choice between slow ruin and unsavory monetization models in financial terms. \n\n\n\nThe second/third order payoffs of exposure, consulting gigs etc. is not as worth it as you’d think. And it’s really not as easy to scale this sort of operation as you might think. Between sites of ribbonfarm scale, and the lowest tier of “professional” media sites that are effectively magazines with a writing staff, there is a nightmare zone where monetization is janky and hard, business models are unstable and ugly, relationships with audiences are in a Patreon-ish badlands zone of crowd-sourced thought policing, and the technical administrative work involved in keeping the whole thing going is annoying and unrewarding. \n\n\n\nI’m still thinking through what to do about this situation and where to go next personally, in a way that allows me to write what I want, without creating a financial discipline management job for me I don’t want, or accidentally creating a media startup I don’t want to run.\n\n\n\nBooks, eBooks and Zines\n\n\n\nI want to round out this whistelstop tour of the textual media landscape with a very brief note on books and ebooks. I have self-published one print book (Tempo), and 9 ebooks for the Kindle. Together these net me a few hundred dollars a month in royalties. Decent pocket change, and far more than median traditionally published authors make, but it isn’t going to earn me any mansions.\n\n\n\nIf I’m being honest, books have become an increasingly unattractive medium for writers like me who primarily developed a voice online. I do not write (or want to write) things with large-scale mainstream appeal. I do not crave the cachet or mainstream legibility that comes with big-publisher-backed books. I have no interest in riding a bestseller to TED or Davos.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, I don’t quite enjoy the experience of retreating for long periods to write 35k-100k words in open loop mode. I think my limit for open-loop writing is about 14k words. For the book on temporality I’m working on now, I’ll probably serialize it online in some form before trying to put it together as a book.\n\n\n\nThe whole point of that 35k-100k open loop mode is to target print books, which have unit economics that lend themselves to 35k+ word dead-tree containers. I’m ambivalent at best about having my stuff available in that form factor. It’s not like I do richly illustrated or complex-layout types of writing. There’s really no good reason for most people to prefer paper for my writing, and several reasons against (paper books having net higher carbon footprints being one of them)\n\n\n\nBut worst of all, books are an absolute bitch to produce (whether you self-publish or work with a publisher), with print books being an order of magnitude more work, and coming with the additional burden of distribution risks. For someone spoiled for a decade by the experience of hitting a button to publish, it seems like a Sisyphean task with dubious rewards. \n\n\n\nI typeset Tempo myself in LaTeX and then paid a friend (thanks Adam) to design and add a cover, fine tune the PDF for PoD print-stability, and generate the ebook for the Kindle. \n\n\n\nFor the next two I hired a friend (thanks Jane) to go from database to html to LaTeX to ebook, eschewing the print option altogether. \n\n\n\nThe next 6, another friend (thanks Jordan) set up a sort of ebook editorial-to-production assembly line for me, without LaTeX or PDF as an intermediate. \n\n\n\nOn my to-do list is to make that assembly line even more efficient, including creating the option of going to print-on-demand easily where that’s a good idea. It’s a problem startups etc have been attacking for a decade, and it’s still not close to good enough. Every year or two, some excited startup founder emails me promising to make me rich by book-izing my writing. They never have the solution and can rarely answer even my most basic questions. \n\n\n\nThe tech part is getting slowly easier. Adding solid design and editorial production values is the hard part, since that’s not automatable yet, but it’s within reach. This whole area is something of an expertise area for me, since I worked on aspects of it for years at Xerox and produced a print-on-demand book way back in 2000. It’s a total grind of a problem. Eventually someone with a sufficiently big warchest will crack it properly. When that happens, I’ll be in line waiting. Until then, it’s a low-priority personal-hack problem.\n\n\n\nAre books worth it? \n\n\n\nEbooks for sure. They allow for a kind of ludic reading experience that browsers and apps still don’t deliver. I don’t get much out of making them besides a small stream of money, but readers seem to appreciate them.\n\n\n\nPrint books? The jury is out I think. I think print is worth it for comic books, art, photography, and complex textbooks. For anything else, ebook-by-default, print-by-exception might be a good standard.\n\n\n\nI honestly wouldn’t care if I never appeared in print again, though my parents are hoping to see another print book out of me And many readers seem to have a kind of sentimentality about print that I don’t really share, but am happy to feed. I wouldn’t mind producing print books if it were technically trivial to do, financially lucrative compared to ebooks, and the carbon costs could be meaningfully mitigated. But it’s honestly not a high priority. \n\n\n\nI’ve personally been using libraries a lot more in the last few years, for both print and ebooks. But increasingly, I don’t like either owning books, or getting print books from the library (who wants the flu germs). I think I’ve gone fundamentally digital-and-online at some deep amygdala level.\n\n\n\nI want to throw in a mention of zines. That’s one print format that does interest me. It seems like an intriguing new medium. Former ribbonfarm contributor Sonya is doing an experiment producing a zine a month. \n\n\n\nZines are on my watchlist as an interesting medium. I have zero interest in the artisan production and fulfillment experience as a producer, but there’s something very zeitgeisty going on there. The message of that medium is interesting.\n\n\n\nText in a Hypermedia Context\n\n\n\nMost attention in the consumer media technology world tends to focus on the latest, most sophisticated media that we can create with networked computing technologies. Right now, the mainstream technological frontier lies in encrypted p2p messaging (WhatsApp, Signal, Telegram) and short-form video (TikTok). \n\n\n\nVR, AR, deepfakes (as a creative medium), and natural-language text-generation (in particular the deep learning algorithm known as GPT-2) are inching ever closer to the mainstream. \n\n\n\nPodcasting is approaching a sort of maturation plateau with the rise of both sophisticated toolchains and maturing automated transcription technologies (such as otter.ai). It’s where blogging was in 2012 or so.\n\n\n\nAll that is important, very important. I’m personally invested in all of it. I have an experimental monologue podcast going over at Breaking Smart, with another conversational one in the pipeline. I am working on a VR game with a couple of collaborators. And as I mentioned earlier, I have been trying to turn myself into a GPT-2 bot (with help from Will Darwin). But in each case, those are evolving Version 0.1 stories. The focus is on the technology more than the content.\n\n\n\nText though, is definitely going through a renaissance, and as primarily a producer of text, that’s what interests me the most. What comes out the other end may or may not look anything like blogging. It might be a case of a New Blogging as an Elder Medium in an explosion of new textual media. Or it might be a case of Blogging is Dead, Long Live Blogging. Or something else altogether.\n\n\n\nRight now, I’m actively trying to reimagine my whole junkyard of a mini media empire from the ground up, thematically, structurally, and financially. We’ll see what sort of new Cunning Plan™ I land on. The Four Horsemen of Textopia will certain play a growing part, as will some random mix of newer technologies. \nShare this:TwitterFacebookPocketEmailPrintLinkedIn",

I look forward to seeing what you come up with.\n\ncc: Kailyn Nelson (t), Phil Jones (t), Brian Sholis, Jack Baty",

They’re the bare fucking minimum we should have been doing all along.\n\n\n\nWe should be demanding our governments enact the TRC’s Calls to Action and the NI-MMIWG’s Calls for Justice. Taking action to stop pipelines, protect waterways and water tables. We need to end the exploitation economy.\n\n\n\nThat’s the reconciliation work I should be doing, and haven’t even started yet.",
