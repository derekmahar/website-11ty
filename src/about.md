Greetings!  My name is [Desmond Rivet][1], a <span class="p-note">software
developer</span> by trade living in <span class="p-locality">Montreal<span>,
<span class="p-country">Canada</span>.  I'm a graduate of the [Engineering
Science][2] program (Computer Option) at the [University of Toronto][3].

I was born in Montreal, but spent a good chunk of my life, including high
school and University, in Toronto.  I moved back to Montreal soon after I
got my Bachelor's degree and started my first job.  Having spent a fair bit
of time in both cities I like to think I'm above the typical rivalry shared
between them.

I've worked as a software developer (junior, senior, staff, etc.) for over
20 years.  My first job was as a summer student, then intern, at [PCI
Geomatics][4].  Next, I had a brief stint as an NSERC researcher during my
last year of University.  After I graduated, I spent a number of years at
Airwide Solutions (formerly Schlumberger), followed by over a decade at
[Intelerad Medical Systems][5].  I'm currently employed by [Unity
Technologies][6].

I enjoy writing and programming (not shocking, considering what I do for a
living), and futzing around with this website is a good way to do both.  I
also enjoy reading, television, cooking, cocktails, board games,
photography, philosophy and travelling.
