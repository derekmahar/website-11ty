Hello! You've reached the personal website of <a class="p-name u-url u-uid"
href="/">Desmond Rivet</a>, a software developer living in Montreal, Canada.

You can find out more [about me][1] eleswhere on this site, and some
information [about the site itself][2] if that sort of thing interests you.

Given that I've been online for over 20 years, I've accumulated a fair bit
of content and, accordingly, a fair amount of thought has gone into its
organization.  Among other things, this site sports:

* a [blog][7], where I publish random thoughts on a semi-regular basis
<!--
* a [piwigo][8] [photo album][9]
* a [wiki][10], which I use to keep track of longer term pages like recipes
-->
* various [selected pages][11] from my old sites
