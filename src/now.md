[Now pages][1] are apparently a thing these days, They are meant to be
living documents, filling in the gap between bio oriented web pages, looking
towards the past, and the kind of up-to-the-minute,
what-am-I-having-for-dinner status updates one often sees on social media.

So, currently, my life looks roughly like this:

* I live in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood of Montreal, in an old, large
Edwardian apartment.
* Currently trying to replace the rusted out railing on my front porch.  Got
one estimate from a company and it was pretty high so I'm looking for a
second opinion.
* I work as a senior software developer at Unity Technologies, doing mostly data
and billing related tasks.  The languages I use most often in my job at
the moment are Typescript, JavaScript, Python and SQL.
* When I'm not working I'm usually tinkering with my website, watching TV,
reading a book, cooking, or baking.
* Current television obsessions: None at the moment.
* Currently reading: Hooked, by A. C. Wise
* Want to learn: ML/AI, photography, graphic design, Cloud basics.
