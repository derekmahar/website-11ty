[Now pages][1] are apparently a thing these days, They are meant to be
living documents, filling in the gap between bio oriented web pages, looking
towards the past, and the kind of up-to-the-minute,
what-am-I-having-for-dinner status updates one often sees on social media.

So, currently, my life looks roughly like this, in approximate order of stuff most likely to change:

* I'm currently learning a bit about Dungeons and Dragons and board game rule systems in general.
* Watching: Star Trek: Lower Decks, Wheel of Time
* Reading: The Three Body Problem, by Liu Cixin
* Currently trying to replace the rusted out railing on my front porch.
* Currently looking into what's required to obtain my Italian citizenship
* I work as a senior software developer at Unity Technologies, doing mostly data
and billing related tasks.  The languages I use most often in my job at
the moment are Typescript, JavaScript, Python and SQL.
* I live in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood of Montreal, in an old, large
Edwardian apartment.
