[Now pages][1] are meant to be living documents, filling in the gap between
bio oriented web pages, looking towards the past, and the kind of
up-to-the-minute, what-am-I-having-for-dinner status updates one often sees
on social media.

So, currently, my life looks roughly like this, in approximate order of stuff most likely to change:

* Playing Baldur's Gate 3.
* Trying to obtain my Italian citizenship.
* Working as a senior software developer at Unity Technologies, doing mostly data
and billing related tasks.  The languages I use most often in my job at
the moment are Typescript, JavaScript, Python and SQL.
* Living in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood of Montreal, in an old, large
Edwardian apartment.
