[Now pages][1] are apparently a thing these days, They are meant to be living
documents, filling in the gap between typical web pages, which are often bio
oriented, looking towards the past, and the kind of up-to-the-minute,
what-am-I-having-for-dinner status updates one often sees on social media.

So, currently, my life looks roughly like this:

 * I live in the Saint-Henri neighbourhood of Montreal, in an old, large
   Edwardian apartment.
 * I work as a software developer at Unity Technologies, doing mostly data
   and billing related tasks.  The languages I use most often in my job at
   the moment are Typescript, JavaScript, Python and SQL.
 * When I'm not working I'm usually tinkering with my website, watching TV,
   reading a book, cooking, baking or playing around with [stately][3] and
   [boardgame.io][2], trying to capture the rules of various board games I
   own.
 * Television: currently obsessed with The Expanse, Mr. Robot, The Wheel of
   Time.
 * Books: currently obsessed with The Expanse, The Broken Earth, His Dark
   Materials.
