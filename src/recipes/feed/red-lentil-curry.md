Toast the cardamom pods, cumin, and coriander in a saute pan for 3 minutes
on medium heat.

Transfer the spices to a mortar and pestle.  Remove the seeds from the
cardamom and discard the shells. Coarsely crush the spices.  Set aside.

Put olive in saute pan and turn up heat to medium.  Saute onion in oil for
2-3 minutes.  Add garlic and chili peppers (if using) and saute for 2
minutes.

Add toasted spices, turmeric, garam masala, salt and paprika to pan. Saute
for 1 minute.

Add tomatoes to pan, saute for 3-4 minutes, deglazing with the juices.

Add lentils to pan, along with the coconut milk and water.  Stir everything
together, bring to boil and simmer on medium for 10 minutes, stirring
occasionally.

Serve with rice.  Sprinkle freshly chopped cilantro, if desired.
