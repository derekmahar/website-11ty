title: Tonic Water (Jeffrey Morgenthaler's version)
blurb: |
  This is the classic tonic water recipe floating around the Internet.
  I personally find it a bit complicated and the lemongrass puts me off
  but you may like it better.

Combine ingredients in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over high
heat. Once mixture starts to boil, reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for
20 minutes.

Remove from heat and strain out solids using a strainer or chinois. You’ll
need to fine-strain the mixture, as it still contains quite a bit of the
cinchona bark. You can use a coffee filter and wait for an hour or more, or
do as I do and run the whole mixture through a French coffee press.

Once you’re satisfied with the clarity of your mix, heat it back up on the
stovetop or microwave, and then add 3/4 cup of agave syrup to each cup of
your hot mix. Stir until combined, and store in the attractive bottle of
your choice.

You now have a syrup that you can carbonate with seltzer water; I use my iSi
soda siphon for some nicely-textured bubbles. To assemble a gin and tonic,
use 3/4 ounce of syrup, 1 1/2 ounces of gin and 2 ounces of soda water over
ice.
