  This is a good, reliable risotto recipe, amalgamated from various sources
  I've found around the Internet
tags:

- rice
ingredients:
- 1/4 cup olive oil
- One medium to large onion, minced

Cook the onion in the olive oil until soft, about 8 minutes.  Add the
garlic, cook for 1-2 minutes.  Add the rice, and coat it until the cores
become visible.  Add a laddle-full of broth to the rice and cook until the
broth is absorbed.  Keep doing this until the broth is all absorbed (about
20-30 minutes).  Add the cheese, salt and pepper at the end to taste.

Variation: Mushroom Risotto: Fry about 2 cups of mushrooms in the olive pil
after the onion but before the garlic.  Add rice and continue as before.
