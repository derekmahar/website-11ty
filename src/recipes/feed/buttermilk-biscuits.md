  Good, reliable recipe for buttermilk biscuits.  If you have a clean
  surface ready to go, these are fairly quick to make.
ingredients:
- 2 cups unbleached all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting the board (if you can get 
  White Lily flour, your biscuits will be even better)
- 1/4 teaspoon baking soda
- 1 tablespoon baking powder (use one without aluminum)
- 1 teaspoon kosher salt or 1 teaspoon salt
- 6 tablespoons unsalted butter, very cold
- 3/4 cup buttermilk (approx)

 1. Preheat your oven to 450°F.
 2. Combine the dry ingredients in a bowl, or in the bowl of a food
    processor.
 3. Cut the butter into chunks and cut into the flour until it resembles
    course meal.
 4. If using a food processor, just pulse a few times until this consistency
    is achieved.
 5. Add the buttermilk and mix JUST until combined.
 6. If it appears on the dry side, add a bit more buttermilk.
 7. Turn the dough out onto a floured board.
 8. Gently, gently PAT (do NOT roll with a rolling pin) the dough out until
    it's about 1/2" thick.
 9. Use a round cutter to cut into rounds.
 10. You can gently knead the scraps together and make a few more, but they
     will not be anywhere near as good as the first ones.
 11. Place the biscuits on a cookie sheet- if you like soft sides, put them
     touching each other.
 12. If you like"crusty" sides, put them about 1 inch apart- these will not
     rise as high as the biscuits put close together.
 13. Bake for about 10-12 minutes- the biscuits will be a beautiful light
     golden brown on top and bottom.
 14. Do not overbake.
 15. Note: The key to real biscuits is not in the ingredients, but in the
     handling of the dough.
 16. The dough must be handled as little as possible or you will have tough
     biscuits.
 17. I have found that a food processor produces superior biscuits, because
     the ingredients stay colder and there's less chance of overmixing.
 18. You also must pat the dough out with your hands, lightly.
 19. Rolling with a rolling pin is a guaranteed way to overstimulate the
     gluten, resulting in a tougher biscuit.
 20. Note 2: You can make these biscuits, cut them, put them on cookie
     sheets and freeze them for up to a month.
 21. When you want fresh biscuits, simply place them frozen on the cookie
     sheet and bake at 450°F for about 20 minutes.
