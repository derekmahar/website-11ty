If your ricotta seems to have a lot of liquid, set it in a fine mesh
strainer to drain off excess liquid about 30 minutes before you start
cooking. If your ricotta seems fairly dry and compact, you can skip this
step.

Whisk together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a small
bowl. Combine ricotta, milk, egg yolks, and vanilla in a separate, larger
mixing bowl. Add the dry ingredients to the ricotta and milk mixture,
stirring gently until just combined.

Beat the egg whites with a handheld electric mixer until stiff (see Recipe
Note). (Alternatively, whisk the egg whites by hand.) Stir a small scoop of
the egg whites into the pancake batter to lighten the batter, then fold in
the remaining whites with a spatula.

Heat a griddle over medium-high heat. Melt a small bit of butter in the pan,
just enough to coat the surface. Use a 1/3-cup measure to pour batter onto
the hot griddle. Cook the pancakes for about 3 or 4 minutes, until the
undersides are golden and you see a few bubbles popping through the
pancakes. Flip the pancakes and cook another 2 to 3 minutes, until
golden. Repeat with the remaining pancakes.

Serve the pancakes immediately, with maple syrup, fruit jam, lemon curd, or
powdered sugar.
