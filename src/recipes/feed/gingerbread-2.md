blurb: |
  This one comes from Nigella Lawson.  More cake-y, less bread-y.  I've found that's 
  it's actually not that sticky if you bake it for an extra 5 minutes.  I've never
  tried this recipe with golden syrup; I've only used a mixture of corn syrup and honey.
ingredients:
- 150g butter
- 200g golden syrup
- 200g black treacle or molasses
- 125g dark muscovado sugar
- 2 teaspoons finely grated ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground ginger
- 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
- 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
- 1 teaspoon bicarbonate of soda, dissolved in 2 x 15ml tablespoons warm water
- 250ml full-fat milk
- 2 eggs, beaten to mix
- 300g plain flour

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C/gas mark 3 and line a roasting tin or ovenproof
   dish (approx. 30cm x 20cm x 5cm) with Bake-O-Glide, foil or baking
   parchment (if using foil, grease it too).

1. In a saucepan, melt the butter over a lowish heat along with the sugar,
   syrup, treacle, fresh and ground gingers, cinnamon and cloves.

1. Take off the heat, and add the milk, eggs and dissolved bicarbonate of soda in its water.

1. Measure the flour into a bowl and pour in the liquid ingredients, beating
   until well mixed. It will be a very liquid batter, so don’t worry. This
   is part of what makes it sticky later.

1. Pour it into the prepared tin and bake for 45–60 minutes until risen and
   firm on top. Try not to overcook, as it is nicer a little stickier, and
   anyway will carry on cooking as it cools.

1. Transfer the tin to a wire rack and let the gingerbread cool in the tin
   before cutting into 20 squares, or however you wish to slice it.
