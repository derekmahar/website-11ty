cheddar cheese.

## Added Wisdom

I use <mi-maigre> ground beef browned just until the redness of the ground
beef is gone in a deep skillet. While the beef is cooking, I break it up as
much as I can with a spatula to eliminate any chunks and get the beef as
granular as possible. I then remove the beef to the cooking pot with a
slotted spoon so some of the juices are retained but most of the fat is left
in the skillet.

I cook the chili in a broad-bottomed, 5 qt. pot. I bring the chili to boil
on a large electric burner and then transfer it to a smaller burner for
simmering—I find the heat easier to regulate that way. I try to get a steady
<localized> simmer where it is bubbling in a couple places but not over the
entire surface area. Covering the chili during the simmer is important, as
is allowing the condensation on the underside of the lid to run back into
the chili—otherwise the chili reduces too much.

After 3 hours, the chili develops a resiliency where if you hit the chili
with the back of a spoon it bounces back. Once you've done a batch you'll
know what I mean. It should not be watery and it should not splatter like
spaghetti sauce. Nor should it syrupy.

I usually use large white onions, chopped as fine as I can reasonably get
them. I use the Clic brand of canned small red beans, just rinsed in cold
water and drained. Any brand of mild cheddar cheese will do—I find the
generic cheese harder to grate, but it melts better into the chili. Any
brand of spaghetti will also work. The spaghetti should be fully cooked or
just slightly al dente—it should be soft enough to absorb the chili juices.
