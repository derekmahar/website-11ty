blurb: |
  I had this in Seville, Spain.  Tasty, quick and healthy.  Some recipes add tomatoes, bread etc. but I prefer to keep this simple.
ingredients:
- 10 ounces fresh or frozen spinach (this is the size of a bag at my supermarket), chopped
- 1 540 ml can chickpeas
- 3 cloves garlic, chopped
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1 teaspoon cumin
- 1 teaspoon smoked paprika
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

Heat the oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat.  Add the chopped garlic
and cook it for a minute or two, just enough to get the rawness out.  Don't
brown or burn it.

Add the spices and toast for 30 seconds, then add the spinach and saute
until wilted and well coated with the spices.  Add salt and pepper.

Drain the chickpeas, and add them to the spinach.  Heat through.
