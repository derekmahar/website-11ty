    This is an amalgamation of various recipes I found on the Internet for 
    southern black eyed peas.  Can easily be made vegetarian by omitting 
    the bacon and using vegetable broth.

Soak the peas overnight.  Discard the water and rinse the peas. Fry the
bacon in a pot until it starts to brown.  Add peppers, onion, celery,
garlic.  Fry for about 3-4 minutes.  Add broth, peas and spice. Cook on
medium, covered, for 30 minutes to 1 hour, until peas are tender.
