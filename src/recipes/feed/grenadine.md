In a saucepan, combine the pomegranate juice and sugar.

Bring to a slow boil, stirring constantly until all of the sugar is
dissolved.

Reduce the heat and cover.

Simmer for 10 to 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.

Allow the mixture to cool, then pour it into a small decanter or bottle with
a tight-sealing lid.

Add a dash or two of orange flower water (don't overdo it).

Seal the bottle and give it a few good shakes.
