Bring cream and sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan over moderately high
heat. Reduce heat to low and simmer, stirring occasionally, until liquid
reduces slightly, about 6 minutes. Pour mixture into a medium bowl and add
chocolate, butter, vanilla, and salt. Let stand, stirring occasionally,
until chocolate and butter are melted.

Set bowl in a larger bowl of ice water. Using a hand-held electric mixer,
beat frosting on medium speed, scraping the sides occasionally with a rubber
spatula, until thick and glossy and lightened in color, about 10
minutes. Use at once.
