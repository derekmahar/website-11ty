blurb: |
  Delicious but very rich.  I usually reserve this for the holidays, often New Year's Eve.
ingredients:
- 1 1/2 cups heavy whipping cream
- (1) 14 ounce can sweetened condensed milk
- 6 cups milk
- 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla
- 2 cups of chocolate chips (milk chocolate OR semi-sweet)

Pour all the ingredients into a crockpot and whisk together until well
combined. Cover and cook on low for 2 hours, stirring occasionally, until
mixture is hot and chocolate chips are melted. Whisk well before
serving. Garnish as desired (which means MARSHMALLOWS of course!)

From source:

> According to Amanda you can also make it with white chocolate, butterscotch,
even MINT chocolate chips! I DO love mint chocolate! The possibilities here
are vast! Iâ€™m thinking of maybe trying a salted caramel version! Yummmm!
