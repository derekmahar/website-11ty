Boil lasagna noodles 10 minutes.

Make the cheese filling in a bowl by mixing cottage cheese, spinach, half
the mozzarella cheese, Parmesan, and egg.

Chop the tofu into small cubes.

Spread a small amount of the tomato sauce in the bottom of a lasagna pan.
Place 3 lasagna noodles in the pan, then more tomato sauce, then half the
cheese mixture, then half the mushrooms, and half the tofu.  Repeat the
layer: noodles, sauce, cheese mixture, mushrooms, tofu.  Add the final 3
noodles, the rest of the sauce, and sprinkle the rest of the mozzarella on
top.

Cover and bake at 375F for about 45 minutes.
