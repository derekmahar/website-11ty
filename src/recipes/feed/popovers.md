Popovers rise by steam, and it's hard to get them right.  If you must follow
just one tip, make it this one: MAKE SURE THE INGREDIENTS ARE AT ROOM
TEMPERATURE.  Warm ingredients make for much better rising.

Preheat the oven to 450°F.

Mix together the flour and the salt in a LARGE bowl.

Whisk together the eggs and milk in a SMALL bowl.

Stir the liquid ingredients into the dry ingredients, stirring the batter
until just mixed.  Do not overmix.

Preheat a popover pan just until hot.  Brush the cups with melted butter and
fill them half full of batter.

Bake for 20 minutes at 450°F.  Turn the heat down to 375°F and bake for an
additional 20 minutes until they are a crispy golden brown.

Serve immediately.
