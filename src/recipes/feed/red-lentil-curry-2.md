title: Red Lentil Curry (Rainbow Plant Life Version)
blurb: |
  I find this curry a bit too soupy, and I actually like the 
  <a href="/2023/02/21/red-lentil-curry">version from Yeung Man 
  Cooking</a> a bit better.
  On the other hand, this one is simpler and involves less chopping, 
  so there's that.  And it's still really tasty. I like it better 
  without the nut butter.

Rinse the lentils in cold water until the water runs clear.

Heat a large, deep skillet or large saucepan over medium-high heat and add
the coconut oil. Once the oil is shimmering, add the garlic, ginger, fresh
turmeric (if using), and Serrano pepper and cook for 2 minutes, stirring
frequently to prevent garlic from burning.

Add the cumin, coriander, chili powder, curry powder, garam masala, salt,
and black pepper to taste, and cook for 30 to 60 seconds until fragrant,
tossing frequently to prevent burning. If using ground turmeric instead of
fresh turmeric, add the ground turmeric now, along the the rest of the
spices.

Pour in the vegetable broth, and use a wooden spoon or spatula to scrape up
any browned bits on the bottom of the pot. Add in the lentils and the
crushed tomatoes and mix well. Reduce the heat to low and cover the pan with
a lid. Simmer for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the lentils are cooked through
and have mostly softened. If you find that the lentils are not quite soft
after 25 minutes, add a few spoons more of broth or water and cook for
another 5 minutes.

Remove the lid and stir in the coconut milk, almond butter, along with salt
and pepper to taste Continue cooking on low heat, uncovered for 5 to 8
minutes, until the curry has thickened and is creamy.

Finally, stir in the lemon juice and cilantro, and turn off the heat. If you
want your lentils to even creamier and more on the puréed side, use an
immersion blender to lightly purée the curry.

Serve the curry with rice and/or Indian flatbread and garnish with
additional cilantro. Store leftovers in the fridge for 3-4 days.

**NOTES**

If you can’t tolerate spicy food whatsoever, you can omit the chili
peppers. If you can handle a little heat, use one Serrano pepper (remove the
seeds) or one jalapeño pepper (with the seeds), and if you really like
things on the spicy side, use two Serrano peppers (with seeds intact).
