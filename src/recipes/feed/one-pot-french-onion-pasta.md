Heat oil over a large skillet over medium heat. When shimmering, add the
onions and a generous pinch of salt. Cook, stirring frequently until deeply
caramelized. About 25-30 minutes.

Add the garlic, mushrooms and thyme. Saut√© for 3-4 minutes or until the
mushrooms begin to soften. Add the wine to deglaze the pan and add the
flour. Cook for another 2-3 minutes, until thickened.

Pour in the beef stock (or vegetable stock) and water. Season with salt and
freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a boil then add the pasta and cook for
8-10 minutes or until al dente. (Keep in mind that other pasta shapes will
have different cook times).

Turn off the heat and stir in the sherry vinegar. Serve warm.
