To prepare the potatoes, scrub them clean if dirty and rinse under running
water. Remove and discard any nubby sprouting areas. Place the potatoes in a
large Dutch oven or soup pot.

Fill the pot with water until the potatoes are submerged and covered by 1
inch of additional water. Add 1 tablespoon of the salt. Bring the mixture to
a boil over medium-high heat and continue cooking until the potatoes are
very easily pierced through by a fork (smaller potatoes are done around 20
minutes, and medium around 25 minutes).

While the potatoes cook, preheat the oven to 425 degrees Fahrenheit and
drizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over a large, rimmed baking
sheet. Brush the oil so it’s evenly distributed over the sheet.

When the potatoes are done, drain them in a large colander and let them cool
for about 5 minutes, until they can be handled safely.

Evenly distribute the potatoes over the prepared baking sheet, and use a
potato masher or a serving fork to gently smash each potato to a height of
about ½ inch. (Thinner potatoes are more crispy.)

Drizzle the remaining 3 tablespoons of olive oil over the smashed
potatoes. Sprinkle the garlic powder, onion powder and remaining ¼ teaspoon
salt over the potatoes. Finally, sprinkle them lightly with freshly ground
black pepper.

Bake until the potatoes are nice and golden on the edges, about 25 to 30
minutes. Sprinkle them with chopped fresh herbs, and serve hot.
