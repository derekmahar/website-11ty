The COVID-19 pandemic put a cramp in my travel habits, as it did with
everyone.  The last overseas trip that Evelyn and I went on was to Poland in
2016 and the last one that we actually *planned* was to Greece in 2015 (and,
my God, it's hard for me to accept that we went to Greece *9 years ago*).
We've been to a handful of relatively local destinations (Vancouver, New
York, PEI) in the interim but nothing particularly *foreign*.

And while I do remain part of an increasingly small minority of people who
still thinks about the pandemic in the present tense, I *also* wanted to
finally visit someplace a bit more exotic.

So...we choose Spain. Or rather I choose it, and I dragged Evelyn along.

I started making inquiries.  What was Spain like?  What was worth seeing?
What wasn't?  From the very few people I talked to, the consensus seemed to
be that:

 - The food was amazing
 - Barcelona was amazing
 - Madrid was...not amazing
 - Seville was gorgeous and underrated

Also, I wanted to avoid a repeat of the madness of Greece.  We managed to
pack a lot into 10 days for that trip, and it was all great, but the trade
off was that we were constantly on the move, never staying more than a
couple of days in one spot.  I wanted something a bit more stable this time.
So, we settled on 6 nights in Barcelona, 3 nights in Seville and 1 night in
Madrid since we were flying out of there the next day.

This trip was planned the same year as people started protesting mass
tourism in Spain and other parts of Europe, and while I hoped that
travelling in September would spare us the worst of it, I also got some
advice on how to blend in...or at least on how to avoid walking around with
a giant neon arrow pointed at my head flashing "tourist".  Mostly this
involved dressing plainly and not being obnoxious.

Did it work?  Were we attacked with water guns?  Was the food indeed
amazing?  Read on to find out!

## There is No Barcelona Syndrome

Our first stop was Barcelona, our home for the next few days.  Before we get
into it though, I want to take a small detour and talk about another famous
and tourist-laden European city: Paris.  In particular, I want to talk about
something called the Paris Syndrome.

Paris Syndrome is the cognitive dissonance felt by many tourists when they
visit a legendary city like Paris.  It's the name given to the contrast
between knowing in your heart of hearts that Paris is the very epitome of
European high-culture and the fact that, when you visit, there are rude
people and dog shit *everywhere*.  It's particularly common among Japanese
tourists, who tend to put the city on a pedestal and who tend to come from
cities where, I can only assume, people are more polite and tend to pick up
after their pets.

One interesting twist to all this is that I didn't actually experience Paris
Syndrome when I first visited the city 20 odd years ago.  I wasn't very
well-travelled and Europe was still so new to me back then, that every
street, every back alley, no matter how mundane, took on an air of the
exotic for the simple reason that it *wasn't home*.  It's not that I didn't
notice the dog shit - I most definitely noticed it - but rather that it lent
an interesting texture to a place that was already bearing down on me with
the weight of its history.

Or maybe part of it is that I come from Montreal.  Montreal has its share of
grime.  The dog shit didn't faze me as much as some people.  Who knows?

So, with that in mind, I would like to point out that there doesn't appear
to be such a thing as Barcelona Syndrome - at least, not according to
Wikipedia.  Everyone I've talked to raves about the place.  Madrid?  You can
skip it.  Barcelona?  Don't you fucking *dare*.  The food, the architecture,
the beaches - by all accounts Barcelona walks on water in a way that Paris
does not.

Why is this?  Is Barcelona that amazing?  Or is it that it doesn't have
quite the same lofty reputation as Paris, and so people's expectations are
lower?  I don't know, but I'll say this.  When I was discussing with Evelyn
how long we would stay, she expressed concern that 5 days would too much.
She was genuinely concerned that we would be bored after day 3.

Since Paris, of course, I've been back to Europe several times and while
many parts of it are indeed achingly beautiful, I've now "been there" and
"done that", so to speak.  I'm no longer impressed by something just because
it's different or "exotic" and I can safely say that it takes more than just
a slightly foreign looking alleyway to engage my sense of wonder.  And dog
shit, no two ways about it, is a blight on society.

So, given that this isn't my first rodeo, but *also* that everyone really,
*really* seems to love Barcelona...how was it?

## Less Vibes, More Sights, and Gaudi All Around

Let's start with the Airbnb.  It was located in the Barcelona Sans district,
right near the train station, and only a 5 minute walk from the metro.
While our accommodations were modest, our hostess was legitimately one of
the friendliest people I've ever met in my life.

Here's where I learned that Duo Lingo is a lie.  Our hostess spoke Ukrainian
and Spanish - but not much English.  No problem, I think to myself - I've
been Duo Lingo-ing Spanish for a over a year and we should be fine, right?
Right?

Hahahahaha!  I don't know if I'm just bad at this but my Spanish was
*rough*, y'all.  As in, non-existent.  We desperately end up relying on
Google Translate here.

Still, our room was decent enough and very well situated, so it was hard to
complain.  And while no part of Barcelona is completely tourist-free, this
area wasn't completely overrun with them, so that was a win.  The
neighbourhood felt...lived in.  Undeniably pleasant, but I didn't get the
impression that everything was there *for us*, if that makes sense.

Our first touristy thing to do was booked for the night we flew in - a tour
of Casa Batllo, by all accounts a "must see", and so we decided we "had to"
see it.  It's a building designed by Antoni Gaudi, a name that comes up
again and again in connection to Barcelona - it sometimes feels like he
designed half the city.  For what it's worth, it's an impressive structure -
the thing looked like it was built from bones; indeed, I later discovered
that the locals sometimes call it the House of Bones.

This feels like a good spot to point out something that immediately sets
Barcelona apart from Paris in my mind, either because I'm less of a
wide-eyed traveller nowadays or because of something intrinsically different
between the two cities.  Paris, to me at least, is the type of city where
you can just kind of...soak up the vibe.  Obviously, there are a ton of
specific things to see and do, but it's *also* possible to just amble along
aimlessly and still feel like you're experiencing something special and
unique.  There's less of that in Barcelona.  Barcelona feels more like a
*city of cool things to see*.  Less vibe, more sights, if that makes sense.

That night, in bed, we discovered why the city appears to have so little
litter, despite being so crowded.  It's because they empty out the garbage
bins *every single night*.  We were woken up to the sounds of glass bottles
being crushed in a garbage truck around 2am.  Good thing we brought
earplugs.  I was prepared the next night.

(Interesting philosophical question: if this had happened while I was in
Paris, would I have chalked it up to the "texture" of the city?  I don't
know but I can tell you that I was certainly not impressed this time
around).

The next day we toured the Sagrada Familia, another Gaudi special.
Nominally a Catholic Basilica, I can safely say that the Sagrada Familia was
one of the top things I'll forever remember about Barcelona.  As one starts
to experience more of Gaudi's work, you begin to notice similar themes.  The
guy was really into making his creations look organic - *grown* rather than
*designed*.  Sometimes that meant making them look like they were built
bones, and sometimes it meant making them look like they were crystals
jutting out of the ground.  In the case of the Sagrada Familia, it looks
like *both*.  I was surprised to learn that it's not the official Cathedral
of Barcelona (that title goes to the much more aptly name Barcelona
Cathedral - by all accounts a much less impressive structure) but given that
it's still not finished after 150 years, I suppose it's not surprising.

Later that day we visited Park Guell, yet another Gaudi creation (this guy
is *everywhere* in Barcelona).  Not quite the jaw dropping spectacle of the
Sagrada Familiar, Park Guell still looks like something out of Dr. Seuss.

## A Brief Culinary Detour

We obviously had to eat that night and so now might be good time to talk
about the food.  It's definitely one of things people tend to comment on
when they talk about Spain.  People seem to love it.  When questioned on the
subject, a friend of mine once said: "Two words: Jamón ibérico".  Another
friend won't stop talking about the paella and yet another friend raves
about the tapas, which is weird because tapas aren't really a *recipe*,
right?  More of a...portion size?

So I'll get this out of the way: the food was...fine.  Tasty, but not mind
blowing.  Just okay.

Maybe it's because I've visited France and Italy where the food was, indeed,
mind blowing, but I found the food in Spain a bit lackluster.  I'm honestly
not sure what the big deal is about paealla; I tried it three times and it
was certainly *good* each time but people sell this dish like it's some kind
of religious experience it just...was not that for me.  To be fair, it's
possible that we simply picked the wrong spots - I'm pretty sure at least of
them was a tourist trap - but it's hard for me to imagine even a
professionally prepared paella changing my life.

And the jamón ibérico?  People will yell at you if you call it prosciutto,
so I won't call it prosciutto, but it's definitely prosciutto *adjacent*,
you know?  It's delicious, but I've had similar stuff before.

One Spanish culinary item that did, in fact, surprise me might not be what
you expect: it was the vermouth.  Vermerterias, bars that specialize in
vermouth, are *everywhere* in Spain, many of them with their own house
blends.  Vermouth gets a bad rap in North America - it's the stuff you
*grudgingly* put into a Martini or a Manhattan - but *good* vermouth is
criminally underrated, and Spain is awash in the stuff.  It was great.

Oh!  And the cheesecake.  I actually really, really liked the cheesecake.
It's definitely not like the firm, almost crumbly cheesecake you buy here,
which I also love.  Spanish cheesecake is less cake and more creamy custard.
You almost eat it like a pudding.  It's amazing.

## El Born and the Gothic Quarter

On the advice of a friend, we booked a free (sort of - these people work on
donations) walking tour for the next day.  While the walking tour was
extremely informative, and our tour guide was very knowledgeable and very
nice, I know that years from now the only thing I'm going to really remember
about it is that the tour took us through the Old Town of Barcelona.

The Old Town, consisting of two areas called El Born and the Gothic Quarter,
effectively constitute a giant exception to my idea that Barcelona doesn't
have much "vibe".  The Old Town is *all vibe*.  The entire neighbourhood is
bursting with charming little cafes, restaurants, side streets and
alleyways, many of which date back to the medieval era, but I can't think of
a single thing that stuck out more than the neighbourhood as a whole.  It's
very easy to get lost here, and it's very easy not to care.

## How to Visit a Beach in Barcelona

Barcelona actually has a city beach, called the Barceloneta, that dates back
to 1992, when the city hosted the Olympics.  It's a serviceable beach that
is nonetheless not the one many people think of when they think of a beach
near Barcelona.  No, the beach that crosses everyone's minds when they think
of Barcelona is *Sitges*, which isn't actually in Barcelona.

In theory, getting there should have been easy for us.  We were right near
the train station!  It's only a 45 minute ride.  This should have been a
cake walk.

Alas, we...did not fully understand how the train ticketing system worked,
and ended buying a ticket to someplace completely different.  Luckily,
Evelyn discovered our mistake before we got too far.  Still...28 Euros down
the drain and we only got to Sitges around 4pm.

It was worth it, though.  The town sports 17 beaches, none of which were
crowded at that time of year and all of which were beautiful.  The
Mediterranean waters were choppy but warm, and became much less choppy the
more you swam out.  I can only imagine how pleasant the excursion would have
been if we had, you know, actually gotten on the right train.

Take it from someone who's been there: make sure you get on the right train!
Words to live by.
