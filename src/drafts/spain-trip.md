The pandemic, as with everyone, put a cramp in my travel habits.  The last
overseas trip that Evelyn and I went on was to Poland in 2016 and the last
one that we actually *planned* was to Greece in 2015 (and, my God, it's hard
for me to accept that Greece was 9 years ago).  We've been to a handful of
relatively local destinations (Vancouver, New York, PEI) in the interim but
nothing particularly *foreign*.

And while I do remain part of an increasingly dwindling minority of people
who still thinks about the pandemic in the present tense, I *also* wanted to
finally visit someplace a bit more exotic.

So....we choose Spain. Or rather I choose it, and I dragged Evelyn along.

I started making inquiries.  What was Spain like?  What was worth seeing?
What wasn't?  From the very few people I talked to, the consensus seemed to
be that:

 - The food was amazing
 - Barcelona was amazing
 - Madrid was...not amazing
 - Seville was gorgeous and underrated

I wanted to avoid a repeat of the madness of Greece.  We managed to pack a
lot into 10 days for that trip, and it was all interesting, but the trade
off was that we were constantly on the move, never staying more than a
couple of days in one spot.  I wanted something a bit more stable this time.
So, I choose 6 nights in Barcelona, 3 nights in Seville and 1 night in
Madrid since we were flying out of there the next day.

This trip was planned the same year as people started protesting mass
tourism in Spain and other parts of Europe, and while I hoped that
travelling in September would spare us the worst of it, I also got some
advice on how to blend in...or at least on how to avoid walking around with
a giant neon arrow pointed at my head flashing "tourist".  Mostly this
involved dressing plainly and not being obnoxious.

Did it work?  Were we pelted with water guns?  Was the food indeed amazing?
Read on to find out!

## Barcelona

Our first stop was Barcelona, our home for the next few days.  The Airbnb
was located in the Barcelona Sans district, right near the train station,
and only a 5 minute walk from the metro.  While our accommodations were
modest, our hostess was one of the friendliest people I've ever met in my
life.

So what were my impressions of Barcelona?  Bear with me, as they have to be
put in context.  Paris may get a lot of the attention as a tourist magnet,
but people are often underwhelmed when they finally visit, what with all the
rude locals, overpriced croissants and dog shit everywhere.  There's even a
whole syndrome named after this phenomenon.

Barcelona, though?  Everyone I know raves about Barcelona.  I have not yet
found a Barcelona Syndrome page on Wikipedia.

## El Born

A lot of the photos from my early trips to Europe (Naples, Paris, etc.)
consist of random, not particularly interesting street shots.  The reason is
that, to my eyes at the time, *everything* looked exotic, even a graffitied
alleyway.

Predictably, as time went on, and I travelled more, these kinds of photos
became less interesting to me.  Eventually, foreign streets just start to
look like...streets.

What I'm trying to say is that Barcelona is not my first rodeo and I tried
to avoid gawking at what I could only assume were perfectly normal features
of a perfectly normal, if tourist laden, city.

Nonetheless, despite my best efforts, it's very hard to do that when you
visit the El Born district of Barcelona.  It's just so darn charming.
