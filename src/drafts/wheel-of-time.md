It's safe to say that The Wheel of Time TV series, streaming on Amazon
Prime, has divided fans of the source material, namely Robert Jordan's
enormous, sprawling, epic book series, spanning 14 door-stopping volumes
published over a period of 24 years (1989-2013).

I would not call myself a great connoisseur of fantasy, but I do know
something about these particular books, having been introduced to them as a
teenager by a high school friend in the early nineties.  I have warm
memories of the series, and less warm memories of the tense, multi-year
waits in between instalments.

Their publication also coincided with the birth of the Web and the
popularization of the Internet that came with that.  It's impossible for me
to separate my memories of these books from my memories of scouring
WOT-themed newsgroups and fan sites, often over dial-up, looking for
plausible answers to the various plot mysteries that had maddeningly
accumulated over the years.

I lasted until book nine, at which point I gave up.  The infamous slog had
begun, and I was knee deep in it.  Sometime after book six, it became clear
to me that Robert Jordan didn't what to do with all the loose narrative
threads he had created, and I despaired of them being resolved in a
satisfactory manner.  He eventually died without finishing his life's work.
I know Brandon Sanderson picked up the baton after Jordan died, but I never
finished reading the series.

I say all this to give you some sense of my relationship to these books - my
credentials, if you will.  I'm a fan, but I'm not an *uber* fan.  I haven't
even read the whole series *once*, let alone multiple times.  I liked the
books a lot, and they definitely left an impression on my teenage mind, but
I can't say that I *loved* them.  I am (or at least was) an *enthusiastic*
fan but I'm not an *obsessive* one.  Keep that in mind for what follows.

## The Difficulty of Adapting *The Wheel Of Time*

When I heard that Amazon was adapting *The Wheel of Time*, my primary
emotion was surprise followed by...curiosity?  I wanted to see how (or if)
they would pull it off.

I mean, adapting such a well-known and well-loved series has to be a
difficult and thankless job at the best of times, but it must be
*particularly* hard in the case of *The Wheel of Time* (and Amazon didn't do
itself any favours by restricting the seasons to eight episodes each).

I mean, with thousands of characters, and hundreds of locations, the sheer
size of it is daunting (understatement!), but it's not just that.

The simple truth is that this is no ordinary book series.  It doesn't really
translate well to a traditional season-based TV narrative structure. There
are reasons beyond its length that it's been deemed unfilmable.

So much of the series is *invisible*.  Aes Sedai in the book are famously
composed - almost Vulcan-like.  Warders, or at least Lan, are famously
stoic.  A lot of the so-called dialogue consists of people thinking to
themselves.  And don't get me started on the background material.  Half of
the story takes place in the insanely comprehensive glossary at the back of
each book, before the meat of the plot even begins.

Add to this: the books are full of characters who often appear in one or two
chapters in one book, and then don't reappear until several (long) books
later (Bors? Aginor? Balthamel? Aludra?).  This might be workable in a
printed medium (barely) but it becomes a real problem when you have to hire
real actors, and you're at risk of losing them to different projects in
between seasons.

The show actually did this with the introduction of Dain Bornhald in season
two.  He's the son of a character that appears in one scene from one episode
in season one.  I can't imagine anyone remembers him and it's frankly a weak
introduction as far as his son is concerned, despite the attempt to jog
everyone's memory with the "Previously on" segment.

It's not just characters - some important artifacts are given the same
treatment in the books as well.  Case in point (and major spoiler warning):
the Choedan Kal are briefly seen in book two, are not mentioned again until
book four, and aren't actually used for anything interesting until book
nine.  How exactly does one adapt this to TV?  Are you supposed to mention
something once in season two and then not mention it again until season
four?

It doesn't help matters that Robert Jordan originally intended *The Wheel of
Time* to be a trilogy - and it shows painfully in the way the story is
structured.  The first three books have a drastically different feel to them
from the rest of the series.  He basically recycled the same ending three
times - it's the same sword fight between the same two characters.  In some
cases, major characters are almost completely rewritten.  Fan favourite Mat,
for example, might as well be a different character in books one through
three.

The series only really starts to break out of this rut in book four and it's
generally agreed that this is when it really starts to come into its own.
This is, of course, easy to say, and not a big deal to patient readers, but
it makes life infinitely difficult for people trying to adapt it into a
episodic, season based format.

I mean, what exactly are you supposed to do?  I don't know, but I'll tell
you what you *can't* do - you can't really do a straightforward "one book =
one season" kind of adaptation.  You need to adapt the whole series at
once, and that's *hard*.  I don't envy the people who've been given this
task.

## Separating the Wheat From the Chaff

Okay. So with all that in mind...how was *The Wheel of Time* show?

First off, before I express any concrete opinions, I do need to vent a
little bit about some aspects of the fandom.  There is a kind of fan who
wants nothing less than a scene for scene adaptation of *The Wheel of Time*
and won't be happy with anything less.  This is something that is simply not
possible, for all the reasons I've already stated, and hence I'm not going
to devote too much time to this type of fan.  I wish them good luck.

Other fans veer into legitimately racist territory, focusing on the skin
colour of the cast.  For obvious reasons, I won't devote any time to these
people either, except to say that for all the show's flaws, the cast is
probably one of the best parts.

This leaves us with the fans who, for whatever reason, criticize *the actual
show* and it's here that I have to be careful because while some (okay, a
lot of) criticism is definitely warranted, some of what I've seen is
just...well...petty.

The books hinted at a relationship between Moiraine and Siuan; the show
makes it explicit.  The books hint at Logain taking over Ghealdean; the show
makes it explicit.  The books hint at the abuse suffered by Egwene at the
hands of Seanchan; the show makes it explicit
