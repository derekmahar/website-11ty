It's safe to say that The Wheel of Time TV series, streaming on Amazon
Prime, has divided fans of the source material, namely Robert Jordan's
enormous, sprawling, epic book series, spanning 14 door-stopping volumes
published over a period of 24 years (1989-2013).

I would not call myself a great connoisseur of fantasy, but I do know
something about these particular books, having been introduced to them as a
teenager by a high school friend in the early nineties.  I have warm
memories of the series, and less warm memories of the tense, multi-year
waits in between instalments.

Their publication also coincided with the birth of the Web and the
popularization of the Internet that came with that.  It's impossible for me
to separate my memories of these books from my memories of scouring
WOT-themed newsgroups and fan sites, often over dial-up, looking for
plausible answers to the various plot mysteries that had maddeningly
accumulated over the years.

I lasted until book nine, at which point I gave up.  The infamous slog had
begun, and I was knee deep in it.  Sometime after book six, it became clear
to me that Robert Jordan didn't what to do with all the loose narrative
threads he had created, and I despaired of them being resolved in a
satisfactory manner.  He eventually died without finishing his life's work.
I know Brandon Sanderson picked up the baton after Jordan died, but I never
finished reading the series.

I say all this to give you some sense of my relationship to these books - my
credentials, if you will.  I'm a fan, but I'm not an *uber* fan.  I haven't
even read the whole series *once*, let alone multiple times.  I liked the
books a lot, and they definitely left an impression on my teenage mind, but
I can't say that I *loved* them.  I am (or at least was) an *enthusiastic*
fan but I'm not an *obsessive* one.  Keep that in mind for what follows.

## The Difficulty of Adapting *The Wheel Of Time*

When I heard that Amazon was adapting *The Wheel of Time*, my primary
emotion was surprise followed by...curiosity?  I wanted to see how (or if)
they would pull it off.

I mean, adapting such a well-known and well-loved series has to be a
difficult and thankless job at the best of times, but it must be
*particularly* hard in the case of *The Wheel of Time* (and Amazon didn't do
itself any favours by restricting the seasons to 8 episodes each).

I mean, with thousands of characters, and hundreds of locations, the sheer
size of it is daunting (understatement!), but it's not just that.

The simple truth is that this is no ordinary book series.  It doesn't really
translate well to a traditional season-based TV narrative structure. There
are reasons it's been deemed unfilmable.

So much of the series is *invisible*.  Aes Sedai in the book are famously
composed, almost Vulcan-like.  Warders, or at least Lan, are famously stoic.
A lot of the so-called dialogue consists of people talking to themselves.
And don't get me started on the background material.  Half of the story
takes place in the insanely comprehensive glossary at the back of each book,
before the meat of the plot even begins.

Add to this: the books are full of characters who often appear in one or two
chapters, and then don't get mentioned again until several (long) books
later (Bors? Aginor? Balthamel? Aludra?).  This might be workable in a
printed medium (barely) but it becomes a real problem when you have to hire
real actors, and you're at risk of losing them to different projects in
between seasons.

And it's not just characters - some important artifacts are given the same
treatment as well.  Case in point (and major spoiler warning): the Choedan
Kal are briefly seen in book 2, are not mentioned again until book 4, and
aren't actually used for anything interesting until book 9.  How exactly
does this translate to TV?  Are you supposed to mention something once in
season 2 and then not mention it again until season 4?

(The thing is, the show actually did this with the introduction of Dain
Bornhald in season 2.  He's the son of a character that appears in one
episode from season one.  I can't imagine anyone remembers him.  It's
frankly a weak introduction).

In addition, the vibe of first book is very different from the rest of the
series, and the ending of first *three* books basically consists of the same
sword fight between the same two characters.  It's generally agreed that the
series only really begins to come into its own in book 4.

The upshot is that you can't really do a straight "one book = one season" TV
adaptation of The Wheel of Time.  You need to adapt the whole series at
once, and that's *hard*.  I don't envy the people who've been given this
task.

## Separating the Wheat From the Chaff

Okay, so with all that in mind...how was The Wheel of Time show?

Given the controversy it's caused, I feel I have to be extra careful and
measured in my response.

First off, before I give any concrete opinions about the show, I do need to
vent a little bit about some aspects of the fandom.  Some
