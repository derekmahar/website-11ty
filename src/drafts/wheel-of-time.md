It's safe to say that The Wheel of Time TV series, streaming on Amazon
Prime, has divided fans of the source material, namely Robert Jordan's
enormous, sprawling, epic book series, spanning 14 door-stopping volumes
published over a period of 24 years (1989-2013).

I would not call myself a great connoisseur of fantasy, but I do know
something about these particular books, having been introduced to them as a
teenager by a high school friend in the early nineties.  I have warm
memories of the series, and less warm memories of the tense, multi-year
waits in between instalments.

Their publication also coincided with the birth of the Web and the
popularization of the Internet that came with that.  It's impossible for me
to separate my memories of these books from my memories of scouring
WOT-themed newsgroups and fan sites, often over dial-up, looking for
plausible answers to the various plot mysteries that had maddeningly
accumulated over the years.

I lasted until book nine, at which point I gave up.  The infamous slog had
begun, and I was knee deep in it.  Sometime after book six, it became clear
to me that Robert Jordan didn't what to do with all the loose narrative
threads he had created, and I despaired of them being resolved in a
satisfactory manner.  He eventually died without finishing his life's work.
I know Brandon Sanderson picked up the baton after Jordan died, but I never
finished reading the series.

I say all this to give you some sense of my relationship to these books - my
credentials, if you will.  I'm a fan, but I'm not an *uber* fan.  I haven't
even read the whole series *once*, let alone multiple times.  I liked the
books a lot, and they definitely left an impression on my teenage mind, but
I can't say that I *loved* them.  I am (or at least was) an *enthusiastic*
fan but I'm not an *obsessive* one.  Keep that in mind for what follows.

## The Difficulty of Adapting *The Wheel Of Time*

When I heard that Amazon was adapting *The Wheel of Time*, my primary
emotion was surprise followed by...curiosity?  I wanted to see how (or if)
they would pull it off.

I mean, adapting such a well-known and well-loved series has to be a
difficult and thankless job at the best of times, but it must be
*particularly* hard in the case of *The Wheel of Time* (and Amazon didn't do
itself any favours by restricting the seasons to eight episodes each).

I mean, with thousands of characters, and hundreds of locations, the sheer
size of it is daunting (understatement!), but it's not just that.

The simple truth is that this is no ordinary book series.  It doesn't really
translate well to a traditional season-based TV narrative structure. There
are reasons beyond its length that it's been deemed unfilmable.

So much of the series is *invisible*.  Aes Sedai in the book are famously
composed - almost Vulcan-like.  Warders, or at least Lan, are famously
stoic.  A lot of the so-called dialogue consists of people thinking to
themselves.  And don't get me started on the background material.  Half of
the story takes place in the insanely comprehensive glossary at the back of
each book, before the plot even begins.

Add to this: the books are full of characters and artifacts that often
appear in one or two chapters in one book, and then don't reappear until
several (long) books later - if, indeed, they ever do at all.  This might be
workable in a printed medium (barely) but it becomes a real problem when you
have to hire real actors, and you're at risk of losing them to different
projects in between seasons.

The show actually tried to do this with the introduction of Dain Bornhald in
season two.  He's the son of a character that appears in one scene from one
episode in season one.  I can't imagine anyone remembers him and it's
frankly a weak introduction as far as his son is concerned, despite the
attempt to jog everyone's memory with the "Previously on" segment.

It doesn't help matters that Robert Jordan originally intended *The Wheel of
Time* to be a trilogy - and it shows painfully in the way the story is
structured.  The first three books have a drastically different feel to them
from the rest of the series.  He basically recycled the same ending three
times - it's the same sword fight between the same two characters.  In some
cases, major characters are almost completely rewritten.  Fan favourite Mat,
for example, might as well be a different character in books one through
three.

The series only really starts to break out of this rut in book four and it's
generally agreed that this is when it really starts to come into its own.
This is, of course, easy to say, and not a big deal to patient readers, but
it makes life infinitely difficult for people trying to adapt it into a
episodic, season based format.

I mean, what exactly are you supposed to do?  I don't know, but I'll tell
you what you *can't* do - you can't really do a straightforward "one book =
one season" kind of adaptation.  You need to adapt the whole series at
once, and that's *hard*.  I don't envy the people who've been given this
task.

Contrast this with, say, *A Song of Ice and Fire*, the series they adapted
into Game of Thrones.  It's much more tightly plotted and it's relatively
straightforward to take the first book and adapt it into a single season of
television.

## Separating the Wheat From the Chaff

Okay. So with all that in mind...how was *The Wheel of Time* show?

Before I express any concrete opinions, there are a few things I need to get
out of the way.  The first is that, as a general rule, I don't consider
"faithfulness to source material" to be the yardstick by which I measure the
quality of an adaptation.  We're talking about fiction here, not historical
documents.  Changes, in and of themselves, don't bother me that much if they
make the story better.  I'm even okay with "lateral" changes - ones that
don't end up making much of a difference at all because, at the end of the
day, we're just talking about two different works of fiction.

For all the reasons I've already covered, this goes *double* for a something
like *The Wheel of Time*.

Second, I need to vent a little bit about certain aspects of the fandom.
There is a kind of fan who wants nothing less than a scene for scene
adaptation and won't be happy with anything less.  This is something that is
simply not possible, for all the reasons I've already stated, and hence I'm
not going to devote too much time to this type of fan.  I wish them good
luck.

Other fans veer into legitimately racist territory, focusing on the skin
colour of the cast.  For obvious reasons, I won't devote any time to these
people either, except to say that for all the show's flaws, the cast is
probably one of the show's main strengths.

This leaves us with the fans who, for whatever reason, criticize *the actual
show* and it's here that we can have an actual discussion.  We're obviously
headed into major spoiler territory here, so be warned.  I'll also point
that that if you're not already familiar with either the books or the show,
then literally nothing I here will make any sense whatsoever - but if that's
the case, then why are you even reading? :-)

On the whole, I *liked* the show, but I didn't *love* it.  I *wanted* to,
and there were moments when I thought I *could*, but I never quite got
there.

There were *definitely* a lot of changes, and they were definitely a mixed
bag.  Some of them made the story flow better, and some of them were, to put
it mildly, utterly baffling.

The show was at its best when it made changes that expanded on
underdeveloped aspects of the books.  Season 1, episode 4 is a good example,
A Logain-centric episode that was never actually described in the books, it
was, in my opinion, the best episode of the season and one of the best of
the show.  I say "one of" because the title of "best episode of the show"
has to go to season 2, episode 6, an emotionally intense Egwene-centric
episode that explicitly depicts certain events that were, at best, only
hinted at in *The Great Hunt*.

Moiraine and Siuan's romantic pairing on the show is another example.  The
books hint that these two characters may have been more than friends at some
point in their past, but it's never made explicit and it's open to
interpretation.  The show makes it explicit, and it adds to the drama.  I
liked the change.

Sometimes, the writers made significant alterations to the lore to simplify
the narrative mechanics, and I'm all for it.  One of the best examples is in
how they streamlined a Forsaken's relationship to death.  The Forsaken, if
you recall, are the Dark One's main lieutenants - *The Wheel of Time*'s
version of the Nazg√ªl, if you will - and, in the books, their deaths were
always complicated affairs.  A Forsaken could be killed, like anyone, but
they could also be resurrected in a different body at the Dark One's whim
later on.  Robert Jordan did this quite a bit - the only Forsaken, killed by
conventional means, that *doesn't* get resurrected at some point is, to my
knowledge, Asmodean.

This kind of works in print, but it's confusing in a visual medium.  You'd
have to get a different actor to play the same character, several seasons
later.  So, on the show, they just make the Forsaken unkillable - at one
point, Moiraine slits Lanfear's throat and Lanfear just magically heals up
and goes continues along as if nothing happened.  If you look closely,
Lanfear's eyes have small specks floating in them as she comes back to life,
indicating that the Dark One is connected to this ability via the True
Power, a little nod to the lore that I very much appreciated.

The only way to permanently kill a Forsaken in the books was to use balefire
and though it obviously remains to be seen, I suspect that show will do the
same.

Of course, not all the changes were positive, and I would be remiss if I
didn't mention the ones that rubbed me the wrong way. I hated everything
related to the Rand-Egwene-Perrin love triangle - it came out of nowhere and
added nothing.  I didn't care for how they gave Perrin a wife just to kill
her off and make him dark.

I *especially* didn't like how the ending of season 1's robbed Rand of his
big power moment against the Trolloc army in order to give it to Nynaeve who
had, by that point, already had several big power moments herself.  The show
does this in season 2 as well; despite Egwene being a *major* part of the
lead up to the the finale, they once again rob Rand of his big moment
against Ishamael by having Egwene attack him and very nearly win.

Some of the problems with the show are less about the changes and are more
structural.  The show doesn't go out of its way to explain how the magic
system works and indeed, goes to some length to de-emphasize certain aspects
that I suppose were deemed "problematic".  The fact that there's a male half
and female half of the One Power isn't specifically established on the show.
