It's safe to say that [*The Wheel of Time*][1] TV series, streaming on
Amazon Prime, has divided fans of the source material, namely [Robert
Jordan][2]'s enormous, sprawling, epic [book series of the same name][3],
spanning 14 door-stopping volumes published over a period of 24 years
(1989-2013).

I would not call myself a great connoisseur of fantasy, but I do know
something about these particular books, having been introduced to them as a
teenager by a high school friend in the early nineties.  I have warm
memories of the series, and less warm memories of the tense, multi-year
waits in between instalments.

Their publication also coincided with the birth of the Web and the
popularization of the Internet that came with that.  It's impossible for me
to separate my memories of these books from my memories of scouring *Wheel
of Time* themed newsgroups and fan sites, often over dial-up, looking for
plausible answers to the various plot mysteries that had maddeningly
accumulated over the years.

I lasted until book nine, after which I gave up.  The infamous slog had
begun, and I was knee deep in it.  Sometime after book six, it became clear
to me that Robert Jordan didn't know what to do with all the loose narrative
threads he had created, and I despaired of them ever being resolved in a
satisfactory manner.  He eventually died without finishing his life's work.
I know [Brandon Sanderson][4] picked up the baton after Jordan died, but I
never finished reading the series.

I say all this to give you some sense of my relationship to these books - my
credentials, if you will.  I'm a fan, but I'm not an *uber* fan.  I haven't
even read the whole series *once*, let alone multiple times.  I liked the
books a lot, and they definitely left an impression on my teenage mind, but
I can't say that I *loved* them - especially the later ones.  I am (or at
least was) an *enthusiastic* fan but not an *obsessive* one.  Keep that in
mind for what follows.

## The Difficulty of Adapting *The Wheel Of Time*

When I heard that Amazon was adapting *The Wheel of Time*, my primary
emotion was surprise followed by...curiosity?  I wanted to see how (or if)
they would pull it off.

I mean, adapting such a well-known and well-loved series has to be a
difficult and thankless job at the best of times, but it must be
*particularly* hard in the case of *The Wheel of Time* (and Amazon didn't do
itself any favours by restricting the seasons to eight episodes each).

I mean, with thousands of characters, and hundreds of locations, the sheer
size of it is daunting (understatement!), but it's not just that.

The simple truth is that this is no ordinary book series.  It doesn't really
translate well to a traditional season-based TV narrative structure. There
are reasons beyond its length that it's been deemed unfilmable.

So much of the series is *invisible*.  Aes Sedai in the books are famously
composed - almost Vulcan-like.  Warders are famously stoic.  A lot of the
so-called dialogue consists of people thinking to themselves.  And don't get
me started on the background material.  Half of the story takes place in the
insanely comprehensive glossary at the back of each book, before you even
read the first page.

Add to this: the books are full of characters and artifacts that often
appear in one or two chapters in one book, and then don't reappear until
several (long) books later - if, indeed, they ever do at all.  This might be
workable in a printed medium (barely) but it becomes a real problem when you
have to hire real actors, and you're at risk of losing them to different
projects in between seasons.

It doesn't help matters that Robert Jordan originally intended *The Wheel of
Time* to be a trilogy - and it shows painfully in the way the story is
structured.  The first three books have a drastically different feel to them
than the rest of the series and he basically recycled the same ending three
times - it's the same sword fight between the same two characters.

The series only really starts to break out of this rut in book four and it's
generally agreed that this is when it really starts to come into its own.
In some cases, major characters are almost completely rewritten after book
three.  Fan favourite Mat, for example, might as well be a different
character by book four.

None of this might be a big deal to patient readers, but it makes life
infinitely more difficult for people trying to adapt it into a episodic,
season based format.  I mean, what exactly are you supposed to do?  I don't
know, but I'll tell you what you *can't* do - you can't really do a
straightforward "one book = one season" kind of adaptation.  You need to
adapt the whole series at once, and that's *hard*.  I don't envy the people
who've been given this task.

## Separating the Wheat From the Chaff

Okay, so with all that in mind...was *The Wheel of Time* show any good?

Before I express any concrete opinions, there are a few things I need to get
out of the way.  The first is that, as a general rule, I don't consider
"faithfulness to source material" to be the yardstick by which I measure the
quality of an adaptation.  We're talking about fiction, not historical
documents.  Changes, in and of themselves, don't bother me that much if they
make the story better.  I'm even okay with changes that simply *don't make
the story worse*.  This goes double for something like *The Wheel of Time*.
There is a kind of fan who wants nothing less than a scene for scene
adaptation and won't be happy with anything less.  This is something that is
simply not possible, for all the reasons I've already stated, and hence I'm
not going to devote too much time to this type of fan.  I wish them good
luck.

Other fans veer into legitimately racist territory, focusing on the skin
colour of the cast.  For obvious reasons, I won't devote any time to these
people either except to say that the show has a lot of flaws, but the cast
is not one of them.

This leaves us with the fans who, for whatever reason, criticize *the actual
show* and it's here that we can have an actual discussion.  We're obviously
headed into major spoiler territory, so be warned.  I'll also point that
that if you're not already familiar with either the books or the show, then
literally nothing I here will make any sense whatsoever - but if that's the
case, then why are you even reading? :-)

On the whole, I *liked* the show, but I didn't *love* it.  I *wanted* to,
and there were moments when I thought I *could*, but I never quite got
there.

There were *definitely* a lot of changes, and they were definitely a mixed
bag.  Some of them made the story flow better, some of them just...*were*.
And some of them were, to put it mildly, utterly baffling.

The show was at its best when it made changes that expanded on
underdeveloped aspects of the books.  Season one, episode four is a good
example, A Logain-centric episode depicting events that happened "off
screen" in the books, it was, in my opinion, the best episode of the season
and one of the best of the show.  I say "one of" because the title of "best
episode" has to go to season two, episode six, an emotionally intense
Egwene-centric episode that explicitly portrays certain events that were, at
best, only hinted at in [*The Great Hunt*][5].

Moiraine and Siuan's romantic pairing on the show is another example.  The
books hint that these two characters may have been more than friends at some
point in their past, but it's never made explicit and it's open to
interpretation.  The show makes it explicit, and it adds to the drama.  I
liked the change.

Sometimes, the writers made significant alterations to the lore to simplify
the narrative mechanics, and I'm all for it.  One of the best examples is in
how they streamlined a Forsaken's relationship to death.  The Forsaken, if
you recall, are the Dark One's main lieutenants - *The Wheel of Time*'s
Nazg√ªl, if you will - and, in the books, their deaths were always
complicated affairs.  A Forsaken could be killed, like anyone, but they
could also be resurrected at the Dark One's whim in a different body later
on.  Robert Jordan did this quite a bit - the only Forsaken, killed by
conventional means, who *doesn't* get resurrected at some point is, to my
knowledge, Asmodean.

This kind of works in print, but it's confusing in a visual medium.  You'd
have to hire a different actor to play the same character, several seasons
later.  So, on the show, they simply make the Forsaken unkillable - at one
point, Moiraine slits Lanfear's throat and Lanfear just magically heals up
and continues along as if nothing happened.  If you look closely, Lanfear's
eyes have small specks floating in them as she comes back to life,
indicating that the Dark One is connected to this regeneration ability via
the [True Power][6], a little nod to the lore that I very much appreciated.

In the books, the only way to permanently kill a Forsaken is to use balefire
and though it obviously remains to be seen, I suspect that show will do the
same.

Sometimes, the writers made changes...just because.  My opinion on these
tends to be neutral.  Many people, for example, disliked the way Mat gained
his extra memories on the show, by sounding the Horn of Valere and suddenly
remembering his past lives.  In the books, it's a bargain struck with some
weird, otherworldly creature in the Aiel waste.  I don't really care either
way - the end result is a character with new memories that will become,
presumably, more useful later on.

Of course, not all the changes were positive or neutral, and I would be
remiss if I didn't mention the ones that rubbed me the wrong way. I hated
everything related to the Rand-Egwene-Perrin love triangle - it came out of
nowhere and added nothing.  I also didn't care for how they gave Perrin a
wife just to kill her off and give him an edge - [fridging][7] at its most
blatant.

I *especially* didn't like how the ending of season one robbed Rand of his
big power moment against the Trolloc army in order to give it to Nynaeve who
had, by that point in the show, already had several big power moments of her
own.  The show does this in season two as well; despite Egwene having a
*major* character arc, culminating in a final confrontation with one of the
more despicable characters in the show, the showrunners still, apparently,
found it necessary to insert her into Rand's final confrontation with
Ishamael.

Some of the problems with the show are more systemic.  The writers don't go
out of their way to explain how the magic system works and indeed, go to
some length to de-emphasize certain crucial aspects that I suppose were
deemed "problematic".  The fact that there's a male and female half of the
One Power, for example, isn't specifically stated on the show.  As I
previously mentioned, I don't really care about "faithfulness to source
material" in and of itself, but this aspect of the magic system is so deeply
entrenched in the books that you can't really get away from it and still
have the same story.  It permeates every aspect of the plot and trying to
pretend otherwise makes for some very confusing TV.

Why is it that only women can use the One Power safely?  Why do men
eventually go mad when they try?  The answer is an essential part of the
book lore - the Dark One tainted the male half of the One Power, and left
the female half untouched - but the show downplays the gender split so much
that I suspect a lot of non-readers don't understand that there's a
difference in the way men and woman channel at all.  It doesn't help that
the show implies that people can switch genders when they're reborn (Nynaeve
as the Dragon Reborn?), or that it's possible for women to give men
channelling lessons (something that's simply impossible in the books).

While we're on the subject of lore, I'll just say that this is a general
sore spot between myself and the show.  I *liked* learning about the history
of that world in the books.  I liked learning about the Dragon and the Age
of Legends.  I liked learning about Artur Hawkwing and his relationship with
Aes Sedai.  None of this is in the show, and its absence is deeply felt.
How are we supposed to know who the Seachan are without knowing about Artur
Hawkwing?  The show mentions *once*, in passing, that the Dragon tried to
"cage darkness", but what does that even mean and why would he do that?  Who
exactly is the Dark One and why would a bunch of channelers go over to his
side?  So much is missing.

It might be a deliberate ploy.  The writers might be planning to trickle the
history out bit by bit in later seasons.  This *might* be their plan but...I
wouldn't hold my breath.  It makes me sad.

So, on the whole, the show is a mixed bag.  The good parts are good enough
for me to say I liked the show.  I will watch season 3 when it comes out.
