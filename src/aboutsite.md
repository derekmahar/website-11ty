title: About This Site
---

I've maintained some form of personal online presence since roughly 1998 or so,
when I made my first hand coded HTML pages available on the web.  There've been several
incarnations of this site over the years, hosted variously on [U of T][1] servers,
[Geocities][2], [Netfirms][3] and a raft of dedicated home and [rented][4] machines,
but the current version is now hosted on [Netlify][5] and I haven't found the experince too
painful so I'm going to try and make it last.

I discovered the [IndieWeb][6] community sometime in early 2019 and I've been since hard
at work to make my site compliant.  Mostly this means that I try to post content here first,
and then syndicate it elsewhere.  My success rate varies.

Given that I've been online for over 20 years, I've accumulated a fair bit of content and,
accordingly, a fair amount of thought has gone into its organization.  Among other things,
this site sports:

* a [blog][7], where I publish random thoughts on a semi-regular basis
* a [piwigo][8] [photo album][9]
* a [wiki][10], which I use to keep track of longer term pages like recipes
* various [selected pages][11] from my old sites
